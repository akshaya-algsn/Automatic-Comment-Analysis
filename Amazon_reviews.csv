"After purchasing the iPhone 13, I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here‚Äôs a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It‚Äôs clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features. Whether it‚Äôs the stunning display, powerful camera system, or impressive battery life, every aspect of this phone feels well-thought-out and polished. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium smartphone experience."

iPhone is only Apple phone. No other wise phone comparative in market than iPhone.
Not that good. Phone is handy and for me I doesn‚Äôt make sense as iPhone X and 15 looks similar and refresh rate too poor. They charged more but big theifs even their competitors are eager to fetch money from customers but not ready to give worth the money. Customers need to slowly have to reject these brands and btw last 14 years using Apple products but it is worst in the sense not much up gradation. iPhone 15 pro max even pathetic
Paying a lots of money for apple 15 .while using apple 15 it‚Äôs gets heats up like a road side brand mobile . Also while on charging mobile getting heats up. It‚Äôs a big with apple 15 . Be aware prior to buy this . I already use this then I share my experience here . Don‚Äôt buy this
I bought the pink one. I could afford it. #milliondollarbaby. I think I would recommend it. Unfortunately I can only afford iPhones
Its very great phone I love it its very nice and great features and love it its very good just go for it
good
Like value for money
Battery backup is very low and getting heated in 15 minutes only this is a duplicate iphone .amazon is selling duplicate
This phone is 5/5 but when you backup your WhatsApp full backup doesn‚Äôt happen and due to which I lot some of my data
"Nice product, safely delivered"
Great performance
Good product
"Ah, major upgrade for me Uk from 4gb storage and 2gb ram phone to 128 gc phone and yea also android to apple, a huge shout out to Apple Inc. For this amazing phone with 28 MegaPixel camera, loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πü´°"
happy with product
Best iPhone in this price
"My office people installed spy app on my mobile, and found Hackable iphone and less online and service centre support."
Experiencing first time üòçüòçüòç Everything is amazing
"First and last mistake in choosing a phone is IPhoneYou cannot even record calls, it may be ban in USA but it‚Äôs not in India. Now a days call record is very important. Other many features you have to buy applications. Mostly important tasks are payable which are free in Android"
"It was a good upgrade for me from iPhone 11 to 15.  Product is great but the customer experience given by Amazon was pathetic.  One lesson I learned, never buy any flagship product from Amazon.  My first order was cancelled due to some technical issue and the second one was due to absolute undervaluation of exchange product (iPhone 11 in my case).  Go for the product..."
Delivery was satisfactorilyProduct was good and safe
Nice mobile. Performance is awesome but pricey.
"Performance , sound quality , value for money , fast charging , touch is very good , battery is üëçüèª"
"Amazing phone, great touch sensitivity"
Am a iPhone fan so no complaints‚Ä¶.
Sound quality is very poor
Main problem with 60hz refresh rateIt's not smooth also battery drainage is a problemMain positive things it's video recording quality(Phato is ok but not high class)And security system is too goodI can't find other positive thingsoverall price is too high  I say it's a overrated products for rough useYou can buy for security reasons and your screen time is under 5 hours
This was my first iPhone using experience.iPhone is better the android .Only draw back is it drain battery fast.
The phone doesn‚Äôt charge and Amazon guys neither gives replacement nor do they help service centre assistance at home. Poor service by Amazon and sub seller who is selling
"Before you go for an s24, remember iphone 15‚Äôs battery and camera and processor performance is way ahead. It lasts me an entire day on 80% charge and just 80% not even a full charge, and the camera is better than most dslrs, use a slim case and do not use the phone while charging and it will never ever heat up. This is the best phone at this price point hands down. Don't waste money on the pro or pro max. The battery is more than enough and if you are a very heavy user then consider the pro max and the display refresh rate is barely noticeable when compared with the pro or max. Only get the pro or max if the extra camera or higher refresh rate (which is barely noticeable) is your concern. The 15 beats every android phone in terms of gaming, smoothness, camera and battery. Ive used the OP 12 and s23 and I would choose the 15 over them anyday."
Camper quality goods
Thank u amazone.
Good product. Camera quality superb.Bit of heating issue but overall nice.Fast dilevery from Amazon . The green color is shiny.
"I love everything like color, touch, back side quality, camera, ultra fast process, etc., and what not?As always Apple rocks"
I hate such a expensive phone heats up while charging with apple adaptor and apple cable.Totally disappointed.Good luck.Update after 1 month- now the heating problem is totally gone. It‚Äôs probably battery initial problem or a software bug that solved automatically.
Not working to friendly apps Truecaller/call recording/and sudirect app really waste of money
I ordered my iPhone 15 from Amazon in the month of November 2023. It worked just fine for few months. After which I was suddenly facing problems with my apps. Specifically Swiggy was not being downloaded and it was saying that my phone is a jailbroken device. I am extremely disappointed with the service.
Battery Draining with in 2 hrs.For charging it consumes min of 1.5 hrs to reach 100%Also Amazon is worst platform to buy this phone.Very worst response
iPhone 15 is faster and better looking than iPhone 12 .
Delivered on same day. Indian version. SBI promo did not work as mentioned. So opted for icici emi on amazon pay card. Nothing to say about iphone. There are plenty of reviews on that.
Really loved the iPhone 15 :)
"worst product that i have ever seen from Apple company, u dont need any kind of stove to coock anything if you have iphone 15 in your hand, trash"
Worth !Camera and Decent Battery
Excellent product. The main concern is while charging the mobile is going too hot. If you touch the mobile whole body is too heating.
Got a very good deal and the model and variant is very Good.Thank you Amazon
"I am using this mobile from past 4 months it‚Äôs value for money , camera quality superb but Apple need to improve battery quality"
Overall good
"Sound quality is very good. Performance is good and transfer of data from my old iPhone happened very fast. Software update was completed immediately after starting the phone . Only problem is that the charging cable is different and it doesn‚Äôt fit into USB port, so one must have an adapter or order one along with the iPhone."
Beautiful‚ù§ pictures
"The iphone was sold with offer that if a buyer moves to airtel postpaid, an additional cashback upto 5000 will came to amazon pay. But after a month, there is no cash back and no communication from amazon or airtel. Looks like amazon is involved in scam nowadays.The iPhone is working fine so far. Good performance. Some heating issues in case of running heavy apps for a long duration and during charging. Rests are okay."
"4* because there‚Äôs always room for improvement. For a phone that pricey, I expected it'll dance and come into my lap for unboxing"
"apple has made it frustratingily difficult to move your images from iphome to wondows pc. itunes on windows does not detect the phone, dont buy."
All good but have little heating problem.
"Received a defective product from Amazon. There was a deep hairline crack in the screen while unboxing the brand new iPhone 15.Initially Amazon didn't take any action or resolution. After I reached out to Apple, got to know that there are no such policies that customer should only reachout to Apple after purchasing Apple products. Resellers like Amazon should be responsible for any kind of damages. Finally after highlighting this point with Amazon, I got my refund.Similar issue happend with the Samsung s24 which I recently purchased.Amazon selling completely defective products."
For daily use
Nice phone.
"Very good battery, very good camera, sound quality is also good. Overall performance is excellent."
This phone iphone 15 have not finger sensor
Display is bad refurbished product sent
"Phone missing, sugar packet inside"
Ok
All over Average

There are some jitters and lags also have heating issue
Yes i usedBattery dry
Got it with a good offer on Amazon. I like the phone. Has a battery that lasts a day and photos are good.
camera quality
Fell to the peer pressure of my grown-up child.....
Amazing supply is very bad and supply to missing product and no replacement Gandhi and missing product Gandhi only purchase Apple Store
Excellent phone
Heats too much that too with normal use
Wonderful performance and touching the liquid feeled screen. Camera for your sweet memories. Clear shots with good storage. Little difficult to WA. Worth buying and good exchange/ bank offers
"Go for it guys , after 3 months of usage still I feel it"
Everything‚Äôs ok ..
Awesome Product. Value for money.
Excellent performance where is my invoice and other formalities? Warranty is also not available .
It‚Äôs just like a mid range android phone which looks good (I guess a mid range one plus would be actually better). Nothing special and absolutely no value for money.
"Good-Battery is really goodPerformance is very goodAnd generally all okBad-Heating issue while charging. It heats up like anything, it will eventually affect battery health in long term. A big downside."
Quality is bad as the phone is heating. The phone is heating and even service centre is not giving any solution. They asked us to format the phone and try. We did that also but the phone is till getting heated to extent that it can‚Äôt be used. The product is defection.
very Hit when using not expect from Apple its unfair Quality not a single piece purchase not a bettery life camera quality and all
Most suitable and superb and awesome phone and fantastic phone forever and this is precious phoneLove for use and compatible for all
Working well after one month of usage with no heating issuesDynamic Island makes the iPhone even easier to navigate between apps

Very good product and I like so nice product top product in India i love this product aaaa aaa aaa
"At starting am hesitating to buy this much costly phone as I am android user and mostly I used android phones below 20k so am not able to take decision to buy or not but I purchased and now am very happy and not getting feeling like why I spend almost 80k for a phone because am enjoying ui interface and many iPhone functions and feel I didn‚Äôt purchase this brand for show off actually am big fan of Steve jobs and I like apple products so overall experience about this phone is awesome and am not getting any regret feeling camera is very good , battery backup also good ,user interface is awesome"
Have been using my brother phone and quality is great.No charging issues.Camera is great.Performance is top notch.No heating issue.Very easy to use
Excellent phone
"I've switched from iPhone 13 to 15 and this transition definitely feels worthwhile. Got this for 66,000 using my SBI credit card + ongoing offers on Amazon.The delivery was secure and the packaging was impenetrable. The device interface is user friendly and the camera......well it's iPhone so you already know."
"Six months in and the iPhone 15 is a letdown. It overheats to the point of being unbearable to hold, even after multiple software updates hoping to fix the issue. The problem is so persistent that it overshadows any other feature the phone might offer. Using it becomes a test of endurance rather than enjoyment. Apple‚Äôs failure to address this glaring flaw is unacceptable, especially for a device that costs a premium. Buyers should steer clear‚Äîyour money is better spent elsewhere."
Working excellent
"The phone heats a lot while using even for basic tasks like scrolling websites or social media. Battery drain is also evident. The battery life is similar to my 4 year old used iPhone 11. Which says a lot about the battery life. Hope apple fixes this, else will likely move to Samsung or Nothing next"
Nice Buy
Awesome
"Very smooth and fast performance,super camera, but heating while charging and using outside, finishing is very premium"
Being an Apple user for several years I love iPhones

This was my first iPhone using experience.iPhone is better the android .Only draw back is it drain battery fast.
The phone doesn‚Äôt charge and Amazon guys neither gives replacement nor do they help service centre assistance at home. Poor service by Amazon and sub seller who is selling
"Before you go for an s24, remember iphone 15‚Äôs battery and camera and processor performance is way ahead. It lasts me an entire day on 80% charge and just 80% not even a full charge, and the camera is better than most dslrs, use a slim case and do not use the phone while charging and it will never ever heat up. This is the best phone at this price point hands down. Don't waste money on the pro or pro max. The battery is more than enough and if you are a very heavy user then consider the pro max and the display refresh rate is barely noticeable when compared with the pro or max. Only get the pro or max if the extra camera or higher refresh rate (which is barely noticeable) is your concern. The 15 beats every android phone in terms of gaming, smoothness, camera and battery. Ive used the OP 12 and s23 and I would choose the 15 over them anyday."

I ordered my iPhone 15 from Amazon in the month of November 2023. It worked just fine for few months. After which I was suddenly facing problems with my apps. Specifically Swiggy was not being downloaded and it was saying that my phone is a jailbroken device. I am extremely disappointed with the service.

It‚Äôs just like a mid range android phone which looks good (I guess a mid range one plus would be actually better). Nothing special and absolutely no value for money.

Quality is bad as the phone is heating. The phone is heating and even service centre is not giving any solution. They asked us to format the phone and try. We did that also but the phone is till getting heated to extent that it can‚Äôt be used. The product is defection.

"Six months in and the iPhone 15 is a letdown. It overheats to the point of being unbearable to hold, even after multiple software updates hoping to fix the issue. The problem is so persistent that it overshadows any other feature the phone might offer. Using it becomes a test of endurance rather than enjoyment. Apple‚Äôs failure to address this glaring flaw is unacceptable, especially for a device that costs a premium. Buyers should steer clear‚Äîyour money is better spent elsewhere."
Working excellent
"The phone heats a lot while using even for basic tasks like scrolling websites or social media. Battery drain is also evident. The battery life is similar to my 4 year old used iPhone 11.

There are some jitters and lags also have heating issue
Yes i usedBattery dry
Got it with a good offer on Amazon. I like the phone. Has a battery that lasts a day and photos are good.
camera quality
Fell to the peer pressure of my grown-up child.....
Amazing supply is very bad and supply to missing product and no replacement Gandhi and missing product Gandhi only purchase Apple Store
Excellent phone
Heats too much that too with normal use
Wonderful performance and touching the liquid feeled screen. Camera for your sweet memories. Clear shots with good storage. Little difficult to WA. Worth buying and good exchange/ bank offers
"Go for it guys , after 3 months of usage still I feel it"
Everything‚Äôs ok ..
Awesome Product. Value for money.
Excellent performance where is my invoice and other formalities? Warranty is also not available .
It‚Äôs just like a mid range android phone which looks good (I guess a mid range one plus would be actually better). Nothing special and absolutely no value for money.
"Good-Battery is really goodPerformance is very goodAnd generally all okBad-Heating issue while charging. It heats up like anything, it will eventually affect battery health in long term. A big downside."
Quality is bad as the phone is heating. The phone is heating and even service centre is not giving any solution. They asked us to format the phone and try. We did that also but the phone is till getting heated to extent that it can‚Äôt be used. The product is defection.
very Hit when using not expect from Apple its unfair Quality not a single piece purchase not a bettery life camera quality and all
Most suitable and superb and awesome phone and fantastic phone forever and this is precious phoneLove for use and compatible for all
Working well after one month of usage with no heating issuesDynamic Island makes the iPhone even easier to navigate between apps

Very good product and I like so nice product top product in India i love this product aaaa aaa aaa
"At starting am hesitating to buy this much costly phone as I am android user and mostly I used android phones below 20k so am not able to take decision to buy or not but I purchased and now am very happy and not getting feeling like why I spend almost 80k for a phone because am enjoying ui interface and many iPhone functions and feel I didn‚Äôt purchase this brand for show off actually am big fan of Steve jobs and I like apple products so overall experience about this phone is awesome and am not getting any regret feeling camera is very good , battery backup also good ,user interface is awesome"
Have been using my brother phone and quality is great.No charging issues.Camera is great.Performance is top notch.No heating issue.Very easy to use
Excellent phone
"I've switched from iPhone 13 to 15 and this transition definitely feels worthwhile. Got this for 66,000 using my SBI credit card + ongoing offers on Amazon.The delivery was secure and the packaging was impenetrable. The device interface is user friendly and the camera......well it's iPhone so you already know."
"Six months in and the iPhone 15 is a letdown. It overheats to the point of being unbearable to hold, even after multiple software updates hoping to fix the issue. The problem is so persistent that it overshadows any other feature the phone might offer. Using it becomes a test of endurance rather than enjoyment. Apple‚Äôs failure to address this glaring flaw is unacceptable, especially for a device that costs a premium. Buyers should steer clear‚Äîyour money is better spent elsewhere."
Working excellent
"The phone heats a lot while using even for basic tasks like scrolling websites or social media. Battery drain is also evident. The battery life is similar to my 4 year old used iPhone 11. Which says a lot about the battery life. Hope apple fixes this, else will likely move to Samsung or Nothing next"
Nice Buy
Awesome
"Very smooth and fast performance,super camera, but heating while charging and using outside, finishing is very premium"
What to tell about apple product security reasons excellent
"*Nothing to say about the iPhone. It‚Äôs the best that is available.*Lot to say about Amazon‚Äôs delivery and exchange. Unfortunately had the idea to buy this with exchange of iPhone XR (bought from Amazon itself, invoice existing). On first attempt, the deliver agent says code fro rabbit exchange not working let me re attempt the delivery tomorrow. That tomorrow became 2 days, after lot of phone calls with Amazon and emails to and fro on 2nd attempt The rabbit exchange app that Amazon is mandating for exchange passed all the test (including battery at 80% life). But in the summery showed ‚Äòmri_battery genuine‚Äô and ‚Äòmri_camera genuine‚Äô as failed and generated a code which the delivery agent couldn‚Äôt input in his mobile. Says exchange is rejected ( mind you no message to that effect was displayed in his app), promptly cancels order and goes away.And that is the end of me buying high value electronic goods from Amazon.Do a favour do not buy with exchange from Amazon! You would save yourselves a lot of hassle.And Congratulations Amazon india folks on completing the process to make Amazon the worst customer centric company. May you crash and burn."
"First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side,  so though it is very good in all aspects,  many people may find it very difficult to purchase ."
Authentic product and 5 star for secured delivery. The seller was genuine and trustworthy.

"Over heating and battery drains quickly, never able to use outside due to over heating.  ... . . .  ."

iPhone is only Apple phone. No other wise phone comparative in market than iPhone.
Not that good. Phone is handy and for me I doesn‚Äôt make sense as iPhone X and 15 looks similar and refresh rate too poor. They charged more but big theifs even their competitors are eager to fetch money from customers but not ready to give worth the money. Customers need to slowly have to reject these brands and btw last 14 years using Apple products but it is worst in the sense not much up gradation. iPhone 15 pro max even pathetic
Paying a lots of money for apple 15 .while using apple 15 it‚Äôs gets heats up like a road side brand mobile . Also while on charging mobile getting heats up. It‚Äôs a big with apple 15 . Be aware prior to buy this . I already use this then I share my experience here . Don‚Äôt buy this
I bought the pink one. I could afford it. #milliondollarbaby. I think I would recommend it. Unfortunately I can only afford iPhones
Its very great phone I love it its very nice and great features and love it its very good just go for it
good
Like value for money
Battery backup is very low and getting heated in 15 minutes only this is a duplicate iphone .amazon is selling duplicate
This phone is 5/5 but when you backup your WhatsApp full backup doesn‚Äôt happen and due to which I lot some of my data
"Nice product, safely delivered"

Delivery was satisfactorilyProduct was good and safe
Nice mobile. Performance is awesome but pricey.
"Performance , sound quality , value for money , fast charging , touch is very good , battery is üëçüèª"
"Amazing phone, great touch sensitivity"
Am a iPhone fan so no complaints‚Ä¶.
Sound quality is very poor
Main problem with 60hz refresh rateIt's not smooth also battery drainage is a problemMain positive things it's video recording quality(Phato is ok but not high class)And security system is too goodI can't find other positive thingsoverall price is too high  I say it's a overrated products for rough useYou can buy for security reasons and your screen time is under 5 hours
This was my first iPhone using experience.iPhone is better the android .Only draw back is it drain battery fast.
The phone doesn‚Äôt charge and Amazon guys neither gives replacement nor do they help service centre assistance at home. Poor service by Amazon and sub seller who is selling
"Before you go for an s24, remember iphone 15‚Äôs battery and camera and processor performance is way ahead. It lasts me an entire day on 80% charge and just 80% not even a full charge, and the camera is better than most dslrs, use a slim case and do not use the phone while charging and it will never ever heat up. This is the best phone at this price point hands down. Don't waste money on the pro or pro max. The battery is more than enough and if you are a very heavy user then consider the pro max and the display refresh rate is barely noticeable when compared with the pro or max. Only get the pro or max if the extra camera or higher refresh rate (which is barely noticeable) is your concern. The 15 beats every android phone in terms of gaming, smoothness, camera and battery. Ive used the OP 12 and s23 and I would choose the 15 over them anyday."
Camper quality goods
Thank u amazone.
Good product. Camera quality superb.Bit of heating issue but overall nice.Fast dilevery from Amazon . The green color is shiny.
"I love everything like color, touch, back side quality, camera, ultra fast process, etc., and what not?As always Apple rocks"
I hate such a expensive phone heats up while charging with apple adaptor and apple cable.Totally disappointed.Good luck.Update after 1 month- now the heating problem is totally gone. It‚Äôs probably battery initial problem or a software bug that solved automatically.
Not working to friendly apps Truecaller/call recording/and sudirect app really waste of money
I ordered my iPhone 15 from Amazon in the month of November 2023. It worked just fine for few months. After which I was suddenly facing problems with my apps. Specifically Swiggy was not being downloaded and it was saying that my phone is a jailbroken device. I am extremely disappointed with the service.
Battery Draining with in 2 hrs.For charging it consumes min of 1.5 hrs to reach 100%Also Amazon is worst platform to buy this phone.Very worst response
iPhone 15 is faster and better looking than iPhone 12 .
Delivered on same day. Indian version. SBI promo did not work as mentioned. So opted for icici emi on amazon pay card. Nothing to say about iphone. There are plenty of reviews on that.
Really loved the iPhone 15 :)
"worst product that i have ever seen from Apple company, u dont need any kind of stove to coock anything if you have iphone 15 in your hand, trash"
Worth !Camera and Decent Battery
Excellent product. The main concern is while charging the mobile is going too hot. If you touch the mobile whole body is too heating.
Got a very good deal and the model and variant is very Good.Thank you Amazon
"I am using this mobile from past 4 months it‚Äôs value for money , camera quality superb but Apple need to improve battery quality"
Overall good
"Sound quality is very good. Performance is good and transfer of data from my old iPhone happened very fast. Software update was completed immediately after starting the phone . Only problem is that the charging cable is different and it doesn‚Äôt fit into USB port, so one must have an adapter or order one along with the iPhone."
Beautiful‚ù§ pictures
"The iphone was sold with offer that if a buyer moves to airtel postpaid, an additional cashback upto 5000 will came to amazon pay. But after a month, there is no cash back and no communication from amazon or airtel. Looks like amazon is involved in scam nowadays.The iPhone is working fine so far. Good performance. Some heating issues in case of running heavy apps for a long duration and during charging. Rests are okay."
"4* because there‚Äôs always room for improvement. For a phone that pricey, I expected it'll dance and come into my lap for unboxing"
"apple has made it frustratingily difficult to move your images from iphome to wondows pc. itunes on windows does not detect the phone, dont buy."
All good but have little heating problem.
"Received a defective product from Amazon. There was a deep hairline crack in the screen while unboxing the brand new iPhone 15.Initially Amazon didn't take any action or resolution. After I reached out to Apple, got to know that there are no such policies that customer should only reachout to Apple after purchasing Apple products. Resellers like Amazon should be responsible for any kind of damages. Finally after highlighting this point with Amazon, I got my refund.Similar issue happend with the Samsung s24 which I recently purchased.Amazon selling completely defective products."

"I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with my iPhone 11 replacement process and the issues I encountered with the vendor's app. First, the replacement procedure was unnecessarily complicated, with multiple steps that were poorly explained. Communication from the vendor was minimal, leaving me in the dark about the status of my replacement.To make matters worse, the vendor‚Äôs app consistently displayed incorrect information regarding the status of my phone. I was repeatedly shown conflicting status, and at one point, the app indicated that my phone is having some camera issue when it clearly hadn‚Äôt been. This caused a great deal of frustration and confusion.Why are you giving people false hope when you know you'll eventually claim an app error to deny the replacement, even when the customer's phone is functioning perfectly fine?Overall, the entire experience was a nightmare. The lack of transparency, coupled with the app‚Äôs unreliability, made what should have been a straightforward process incredibly stressful. I expected much better service and functionality, especially given the high cost of Apple products. This experience has significantly diminished my trust in both the vendor and the brand."
I like it
"Got a faulty phone , after one update it crashed"
Nice phone
Received the Iphone with dead pixels
"So what could have been a great phone has turned into an absolute mockery! My 4.5 year old iPhone 11 is still running well and was a great value for money in the sense that I used it for 4 years instead of 2 that I did my previous phones, it is still serving well, but this one DOES NOT GET AI FEATURES! I still can't digest this, that this is still the latest iphone you can buy in the market, it sells for more than flagship prices and comes with lesser features than competitors and Apple chose not to provide AI features with it making this absolutely unacceptable. Apparently Apple cheaped out on RAM in this and only provided 6 gb whereas AI requires minimum 8 gb of RAM and this is the reason even M1 laptops and tablets with weaker NPU than iPhone 15 get AI and this doesn't! It would have been acceptable if it was a budget/flagship killer costing 30K or below but at this price it is a travesty!Second is the battery! My iPhone 11 with 1150 cycles still has 82% battery health but this one, even with using 80% charge limit function after just 185 cycles is at 94% and lasts noticeably less than when it was new! Just shows Apple is killing this phone on purpose to sell future models and the once mighty Apple who made trouble free actually premium flagships has nothing to innovate and is resorting to cheap tactics to sell phones.Really disappointed!"
"I am facing heating issue while taking photos or videos. Just more than a minute phone got heated. And amazon not providing doorstep technician to this product. They asking me to travel 45 km afar apple service center, to check the phone and get denying letter.Also i have called tollfree number of apple service, they informed i will not face such issue if i bought product from there site, instead of 3rd party. Moreover i have informed the customer service issue on the same day but they are saying no techincian available for this product....And this is not mentioned in the description as well."
You can found best apples in the forest of amazon only. Nice product.
100% ok
"The Product, It's just decent.. It's cheap since I got it for like 64 k 6 months ago, I could have gotten it for even cheaper nowadays but whatever, The price is okay, The phone is pretty much durable, It fell off a floor and had no scratches or anything even though it fell on the floor, it fell on it's side so it was okay, The durability is then, Fine. The appearance.. I bought a pink iphone 15, I should have bought a grey Iphone 15 pro or smth but I saw a few bad reviews about the pro version so I thought I'd buy the pro version of Iphone 16-17 when it releases, So I'm not gonna get AI Aka Apple Intelligence, I'm also a beta user of IOS 18. The phone is fast and runs any game fine unlike the same spec android phones I have, It's smooth and battery lasted 16-17 hours when I played COD with highest graphics and It'd sometimes only stay for 11 Hours, But if you only use it for daily stuff like office or studying, It'll last days.. I bought a airpod pro with this item and they do pair well, the only issue is, I hope they had a password for connecting airpods. The connectivity is fine and the appearance is okay and the smoothness is pretty smooth, Go for it since it's a cheap phone and not that expensive, Don't mind the people who're saying it's bad or expensive since they're probably living in a third world country or something, Iphones are pretty privacy built, but there are things to improve but I'd get more wink of a sleep with it than a android as, Android is creepy with those spot on ads ;; and iphone's aren't free from it if you use google services, so I deleted every google service except gmail and just living, It's a long lasting budget friendly phone, go for it"
After so many follow ups finally received a product. Product is good
"it‚Äôs the best smart phone ( based on personal preference ) available in the market , by all means it does justifies it‚Äôs hype.also got it at such a stealing price, thank you Amazonüôè"
Good price
"A phone is good and fantasting, and battery is long lasting and charging good, display is smooth and indisplay fingers pin sansor ,"
Very good product .. awesome product .. camera is very good . Connectivity is very goodFor this product . Good mobile phone
This is my second apple order from Amazon. I've also directly ordered from Apple website and I can say that the product is genuine and exactly same as when I get from Apple website. Quick delivery and securely sealed. Kudos to Amazon for trustworthy delivery.
Torn packaging and phone was overheating on the first use.
I got the best experience by the iPhone but I have a humble request from apple that close the emi system a person who seels momos is having this mobile .
CAMERA EXCELLENT.Charger should be included.
What to tell about apple product security reasons excellent

Communication from the vendor was minimal, leaving me in the dark about the status of my replacement.To make matters worse, the vendor‚Äôs app consistently displayed incorrect information regarding the status of my phone. I was repeatedly shown conflicting status, and at one point, the app indicated that my phone is having some camera issue when it clearly hadn‚Äôt been. This caused a great deal of frustration and confusion.Why are you giving people false hope when you know you'll eventually claim an app error to deny the replacement, even when the customer's phone is functioning perfectly fine?Overall, the entire experience was a nightmare. The lack of transparency, coupled with the app‚Äôs unreliability, made what should have been a straightforward process incredibly stressful. I expected much better service and functionality, especially given the high cost of Apple products. This experience has significantly diminished my trust in both the vendor and the brand."
I like it
"Got a faulty phone , after one update it crashed"
Nice phone
Received the Iphone with dead pixels
"So what could have been a great phone has turned into an absolute mockery! My 4.5 year old iPhone 11 is still running well and was a great value for money in the sense that I used it for 4 years instead of 2 that I did my previous phones, it is still serving well, but this one DOES NOT GET AI FEATURES! I still can't digest this, that this is still the latest iphone you can buy in the market, it sells for more than flagship prices and comes with lesser features than competitors and Apple chose not to provide AI features with it making this absolutely unacceptable. Apparently Apple cheaped out on RAM in this and only provided 6 gb whereas AI requires minimum 8 gb of RAM and this is the reason even M1 laptops and tablets with weaker NPU than iPhone 15 get AI and this doesn't! It would have been acceptable if it was a budget/flagship killer costing 30K or below but at this price it is a travesty!Second is the battery! My iPhone 11 with 1150 cycles still has 82% battery health but this one, even with using 80% charge limit function after just 185 cycles is at 94% and lasts noticeably less than when it was new! Just shows Apple is killing this phone on purpose to sell future models and the once mighty Apple who made trouble free actually premium flagships has nothing to innovate and is resorting to cheap tactics to sell phones.Really disappointed!"
"I am facing heating issue while taking photos or videos. Just more than a minute phone got heated. And amazon not providing doorstep technician to this product. They asking me to travel 45 km afar apple service center, to check the phone and get denying letter.Also i have called tollfree number of apple service, they informed i will not face such issue if i bought product from there site, instead of 3rd party. Moreover i have informed the customer service issue on the same day but they are saying no techincian available for this product....And this is not mentioned in the description as well."
You can found best apples in the forest of amazon only. Nice product.
100% ok
"The Product, It's just decent.. It's cheap since I got it for like 64 k 6 months ago, I could have gotten it for even cheaper nowadays but whatever, The price is okay, The phone is pretty much durable, It fell off a floor and had no scratches or anything even though it fell on the floor, it fell on it's side so it was okay, The durability is then, Fine. The appearance.. I bought a pink iphone 15, I should have bought a grey Iphone 15 pro or smth but I saw a few bad reviews about the pro version so I thought I'd buy the pro version of Iphone 16-17 when it releases, So I'm not gonna get AI Aka Apple Intelligence, I'm also a beta user of IOS 18. The phone is fast and runs any game fine unlike the same spec android phones I have, It's smooth and battery lasted 16-17 hours when I played COD with highest graphics and It'd sometimes only stay for 11 Hours, But if you only use it for daily stuff like office or studying, It'll last days.. I bought a airpod pro with this item and they do pair well, the only issue is, I hope they had a password for connecting airpods. The connectivity is fine and the appearance is okay and the smoothness is pretty smooth, Go for it since it's a cheap phone and not that expensive, Don't mind the people who're saying it's bad or expensive since they're probably living in a third world country or something, Iphones are pretty privacy built, but there are things to improve but I'd get more wink of a sleep with it than a android as, Android is creepy with those spot on ads ;; and iphone's aren't free from it if you use google services, so I deleted every google service except gmail and just living, It's a long lasting budget friendly phone, go for it"
After so many follow ups finally received a product. Product is good
"it‚Äôs the best smart phone ( based on personal preference ) available in the market , by all means it does justifies it‚Äôs hype.also got it at such a stealing price, thank you Amazonüôè"
Good price
"A phone is good and fantasting, and battery is long lasting and charging good, display is smooth and indisplay fingers pin sansor ,"
Very good product .. awesome product .. camera is very good . Connectivity is very goodFor this product . Good mobile phone
This is my second apple order from Amazon. I've also directly ordered from Apple website and I can say that the product is genuine and exactly same as when I get from Apple website. Quick delivery and securely sealed. Kudos to Amazon for trustworthy delivery.
Torn packaging and phone was overheating on the first use.
I got the best experience by the iPhone but I have a humble request from apple that close the emi system a person who seels momos is having this mobile .
CAMERA EXCELLENT.Charger should be included.
What to tell about apple product security reasons excellent
"*Nothing to say about the iPhone. It‚Äôs the best that is available.*Lot to say about Amazon‚Äôs delivery and exchange. Unfortunately had the idea to buy this with exchange of iPhone XR (bought from Amazon itself, invoice existing). On first attempt, the deliver agent says code fro rabbit exchange not working let me re attempt the delivery tomorrow. That tomorrow became 2 days, after lot of phone calls with Amazon and emails to and fro on 2nd attempt The rabbit exchange app that Amazon is mandating for exchange passed all the test (including battery at 80% life). But in the summery showed ‚Äòmri_battery genuine‚Äô and ‚Äòmri_camera genuine‚Äô as failed and generated a code which the delivery agent couldn‚Äôt input in his mobile. Says exchange is rejected ( mind you no message to that effect was displayed in his app), promptly cancels order and goes away.And that is the end of me buying high value electronic goods from Amazon.Do a favour do not buy with exchange from Amazon! You would save yourselves a lot of hassle.And Congratulations Amazon india folks on completing the process to make Amazon the worst customer centric company. May you crash and burn."
"First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side,  so though it is very good in all aspects,  many people may find it very difficult to purchase ."
Authentic product and 5 star for secured delivery. The seller was genuine and trustworthy.
I like
"Over heating and battery drains quickly, never able to use outside due to over heating.  ... . . .  ."
Good
iPhone is only Apple phone. No other wise phone comparative in market than iPhone.
Not that good. Phone is handy and for me I doesn‚Äôt make sense as iPhone X and 15 looks similar and refresh rate too poor. They charged more but big theifs even their competitors are eager to fetch money from customers but not ready to give worth the money. Customers need to slowly have to reject these brands and btw last 14 years using Apple products but it is worst in the sense not much up gradation. iPhone 15 pro max even pathetic
Paying a lots of money for apple 15 .while using apple 15 it‚Äôs gets heats up like a road side brand mobile . Also while on charging mobile getting heats up. It‚Äôs a big with apple 15 . Be aware prior to buy this . I already use this then I share my experience here . Don‚Äôt buy this
I bought the pink one. I could afford it. #milliondollarbaby. I think I would recommend it. Unfortunately I can only afford iPhones
Its very great phone I love it its very nice and great features and love it its very good just go for it
good
Like value for money
Battery backup is very low and getting heated in 15 minutes only this is a duplicate iphone .amazon is selling duplicate
This phone is 5/5 but when you backup your WhatsApp full backup doesn‚Äôt happen and due to which I lot some of my data
"Nice product, safely delivered"
Great performance
Good product
"Ah, major upgrade for me Uk from 4gb storage and 2gb ram phone to 128 gc phone and yea also android to apple, a huge shout out to Apple Inc. For this amazing phone with 28 MegaPixel camera, loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πü´°"
happy with product
Best iPhone in this price
"My office people installed spy app on my mobile, and found Hackable iphone and less online and service centre support."
Experiencing first time üòçüòçüòç Everything is amazing
"First and last mistake in choosing a phone is IPhoneYou cannot even record calls, it may be ban in USA but it‚Äôs not in India. Now a days call record is very important. Other many features you have to buy applications. Mostly important tasks are payable which are free in Android"
"It was a good upgrade for me from iPhone 11 to 15.  Product is great but the customer experience given by Amazon was pathetic.  One lesson I learned, never buy any flagship product from Amazon.  My first order was cancelled due to some technical issue and the second one was due to absolute undervaluation of exchange product (iPhone 11 in my case).  Go for the product..."
Delivery was satisfactorilyProduct was good and safe
Nice mobile. Performance is awesome but pricey.
"Performance , sound quality , value for money , fast charging , touch is very good , battery is üëçüèª"
"Amazing phone, great touch sensitivity"
Am a iPhone fan so no complaints‚Ä¶.
Sound quality is very poor
Main problem with 60hz refresh rateIt's not smooth also battery drainage is a problemMain positive things it's video recording quality(Phato is ok but not high class)And security system is too goodI can't find other positive thingsoverall price is too high  I say it's a overrated products for rough useYou can buy for security reasons and your screen time is under 5 hours
This was my first iPhone using experience.iPhone is better the android .Only draw back is it drain battery fast.
The phone doesn‚Äôt charge and Amazon guys neither gives replacement nor do they help service centre assistance at home. Poor service by Amazon and sub seller who is selling
"Before you go for an s24, remember iphone 15‚Äôs battery and camera and processor performance is way ahead. It lasts me an entire day on 80% charge and just 80% not even a full charge, and the camera is better than most dslrs, use a slim case and do not use the phone while charging and it will never ever heat up. This is the best phone at this price point hands down. Don't waste money on the pro or pro max. The battery is more than enough and if you are a very heavy user then consider the pro max and the display refresh rate is barely noticeable when compared with the pro or max. Only get the pro or max if the extra camera or higher refresh rate (which is barely noticeable) is your concern. The 15 beats every android phone in terms of gaming, smoothness, camera and battery. Ive used the OP 12 and s23 and I would choose the 15 over them anyday."
Camper quality goods
Thank u amazone.
Good product. Camera quality superb.Bit of heating issue but overall nice.Fast dilevery from Amazon . The green color is shiny.
"I love everything like color, touch, back side quality, camera, ultra fast process, etc., and what not?As always Apple rocks"
I hate such a expensive phone heats up while charging with apple adaptor and apple cable.Totally disappointed.Good luck.Update after 1 month- now the heating problem is totally gone. It‚Äôs probably battery initial problem or a software bug that solved automatically.
Not working to friendly apps Truecaller/call recording/and sudirect app really waste of money
I ordered my iPhone 15 from Amazon in the month of November 2023. It worked just fine for few months. After which I was suddenly facing problems with my apps. Specifically Swiggy was not being downloaded and it was saying that my phone is a jailbroken device. I am extremely disappointed with the service.
Battery Draining with in 2 hrs.For charging it consumes min of 1.5 hrs to reach 100%Also Amazon is worst platform to buy this phone.Very worst response
iPhone 15 is faster and better looking than iPhone 12 .
Delivered on same day. Indian version. SBI promo did not work as mentioned. So opted for icici emi on amazon pay card. Nothing to say about iphone. There are plenty of reviews on that.
Really loved the iPhone 15 :)
"worst product that i have ever seen from Apple company, u dont need any kind of stove to coock anything if you have iphone 15 in your hand, trash"
Worth !Camera and Decent Battery
Excellent product. The main concern is while charging the mobile is going too hot. If you touch the mobile whole body is too heating.
Got a very good deal and the model and variant is very Good.Thank you Amazon
"I am using this mobile from past 4 months it‚Äôs value for money , camera quality superb but Apple need to improve battery quality"
Overall good
"Sound quality is very good. Performance is good and transfer of data from my old iPhone happened very fast. Software update was completed immediately after starting the phone . Only problem is that the charging cable is different and it doesn‚Äôt fit into USB port, so one must have an adapter or order one along with the iPhone."
Beautiful‚ù§ pictures
"The iphone was sold with offer that if a buyer moves to airtel postpaid, an additional cashback upto 5000 will came to amazon pay. But after a month, there is no cash back and no communication from amazon or airtel. Looks like amazon is involved in scam nowadays.The iPhone is working fine so far. Good performance. Some heating issues in case of running heavy apps for a long duration and during charging. Rests are okay."
"4* because there‚Äôs always room for improvement. For a phone that pricey, I expected it'll dance and come into my lap for unboxing"
"apple has made it frustratingily difficult to move your images from iphome to wondows pc. itunes on windows does not detect the phone, dont buy."
All good but have little heating problem.
"Received a defective product from Amazon. There was a deep hairline crack in the screen while unboxing the brand new iPhone 15.Initially Amazon didn't take any action or resolution. After I reached out to Apple, got to know that there are no such policies that customer should only reachout to Apple after purchasing Apple products. Resellers like Amazon should be responsible for any kind of damages. Finally after highlighting this point with Amazon, I got my refund.Similar issue happend with the Samsung s24 which I recently purchased.Amazon selling completely defective products."

Good One
I have purchased the invoiced laptop in Oct 23 and same is till under warranty. However it's AC/DC adopter is not functioning and need to be exchanged. So I am requested to send the replaced item at the earliest
Before you buy check fully description carefully.Keypad backlit not working with this model.Sound quality not good.
Do not buy laptops online. No support once you have bought. Brand will ask you to connect with Amazon & Amazon will push you to Brand. Pls buy from any  offline store.
Battery backup not good
"I bought this laptop at a very low price during the offer on 15th August, I used this company's laptop before, Acer laptop is my favorite, I have been using it for two days, very good performance,"
"1st acer aspire i3 laptop order on 07-08-2024 & Received the laptop on 09-08-2024  full full Satisfactory  working performance the Acer laptop,thanks to Amazon team."
"The laptop is very poor quality , I don't know how to return it plz help"
A class... everything is verygood  at this price
"I was in a huge confusion while buying this product, but now after I got it, i recommend for those who are looking for a budget laptop with good specs and sound and displayAlso it comes with MSO, I am not sure why it was not highlighted in the descriptionAnd looking at the battery rated capacity and 45w charger I guess it's a good pick.And I got it for almost 27k with all bank offers and as a prime customer, I got the delivery the next day"
It's almost 1 year of use no problem at all. Good quality by acer and thanks to Amazon.

No charger
The product key is not given by the company so i think that‚Äôs not good ..
"This product does not come with Microsoft Office. And in any case if you reach out to Acee service, they don't attend you. The worst service support they have."
Battery life is a bit short.
Laptop mast h..hme 26k me sbi card pe mila.. sb bdhiya h but ek issue h ki sound thoda kam h spekar ka.. baki har tarh se best laga... Aap beshk le skte h.... Value for money.. easy to use hai...
Core i3 suitable for moderate use. Good build and enough connectors on either side. Very cost competitive.
Received the laptop yesterday only. The Display type is not mentioned any where in the products specification page in amazon. Its an TFT display with narrow viewing angles. however the display looks crisp when looking from front. Sound volume is very low cannot be used for video conferencing or attending class if there is ambient noise around. Otherwise the laptop feels preppy and fast. On the software side the laptop lacks MS office license which have to be purchase separately. Better to go for laptops that come with MSO.
Gud product satisfied üòå üëå
"AFTER 1 MONTH USE FOR ONLY PERSONAL WORK, GIVING FEEDBACK ""DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT"". TIGHT FROM THE FIRST DAY U WIL FEEL LAG WHILE USING, CANT USE HEAVY FILE ON THIS.

My screen stopped working within 10 months and company is refusing to repair it under warranty and there is no physical damage also. Do not buy at all not a reliable product
"Everything about this laptop is absolutely fine, except the display quality and the battery life both are really a big disappointment."
"Received Faulty Product with No support from Amazon not From Accerr, Request don't buy this product at all"

acha hai laptop
The power button of the laptop is problematic.  The laptop doesn't get on when we press the power button. One need to put the laptop on charge to turn it on. I first thought that the laptop is not charged hence it is happening but this happens again and again as when the laptop turns on it shows more that 50% charged but it doesn't get turned on without putting on charge.
"Seems like clearance sale ,the product is damm slow and bad with system. Response time of customer care is bad"
Not able activate ms office. Please give me any suggestion to activate
Sound quality is worst and laptop heating too much I contact acer technical team but they are also not able to resolve the problem
Nice and powerful pc according to budget value for money

"This tv is a garbage. Within 6 months of buying the tv, it has a number issue. It keeps on disconnecting from soundbar. In the middle of watching the video, it frequently crashes ( check video)and never recoveres. Customer care sucks big time as nobody is there to respond. Once you buy this product, you get entrapped. Better buy a branded product. This is just a Cheap Chinese product. Wasted my hmoney. Does not even deserve a single star."
stand not provided with TV
"Picture quality, Bluetooth connectivity and voice recognition is great."
Superb quality product and sound quality superb
"Display has gone in 2years, luckily i had only 10 days of warrenty period so got panel changed, however the branded tv display not serving for 2 years was very disappointed."
"I purchased a TV last year, and unfortunately, my experience has been very disappointing. When I encountered issues with the TV, I reached out to the brand's service center, but they were unable to assist me. The reason? The serial number on my invoice didn't match the serial number on the TV. Additionally, it seems that a 32-inch board was used in my 43-inch TV, raising serious concerns about the product's quality.Even though I tried to resolve this through Amazon support by providing all requested screenshots, pictures, and documents, I have received no response for over 20 days. The lack of customer service and support has been incredibly frustrating.If you see any offers for this TV/Seller, be cautious and avoid them. There's no real benefit to these supposed deals, and you might end up facing costly problems. Save your hard-earned money and avoid this product/seller."
Screen got black. Only sound is coming. Happens after warranty completion. Happens with many who bought MI tv. Fooling customers by giving less standard products. Made for 2 years only. Display shot hona hi hona he. 2-3 year duration main.

"Unfortunately, the TV display seems to be compromised. It doesn't look original, as there are light grey lines all over the display panel, similar to local displays. These lines appear on the home screen as well as during some content.Moreover, the GUI lags a lot all the time, whether it's opening any app or switching to another video on YouTube.Additionally, the TV is not capable of handling 4K UHD videos on YouTube. Whenever I switch to 2160 HDR content, the video gets stuck.  I wanted to add a video review, but I don't want to waste my time doing so.I'm disappointed to say that it would be better to consider another TV instead."
Mi Tv is good working
"This is really product issue.Screen was invisible after 1.5 years of purcahse means out of warranty.All functions are running like sound and all but we can't able to see anything just like black screen.In my knowing person this is second case.Build quality is like just to sustain the warranty period, after that no faith on product that how much time will be run further."
This TV not supported to wireless connect display if we want to share the screen of laptop
"My tv was having no sound no picture since 25june2024. I've registered complain through their mi app. After registering their technician came after 10 days which was expected within 2 days after registering complaint. Today is 7th Aug and till date my tv is in there service station, and they are telling your broken panel is still in delhi ..........!This is absolutely disgusting and irritating service I've ever experienced with a particular brand."
Not a good product. We have been struggling with this tv for a year now and its a task to even watch tv now
"No problem with Xiaomi 43 inch X-PRO model working satisfactory till date. As mentioned on Amazon website premium installation is free at the time of delivery, that is absolutely not true. Two strips has been provided with delivery as table stand, which is not at all safe for domestic purpose. Xiaomi technician is to be booked separetly at xiaomi website for wall installation, perhaps done by more than 90% . For wall hanging mateial One / I have paid ‚Çπ500 extra and made repeated requests for installation. This must be cleared on Amazon website for customers. Further extended warranty / warranrty norms be cleared for customers.K N KatyalNew Delhi"
It's a poor product with a slow ram and processor. Not worth for a TV in the range of 40K. Takes atleast 5 minutes to be internet ready.Not advisable to buy in today's era.Hope the manufacturers are listening.
"I'm writing this review after using more then 15 days. X pro Series have much better result to MI normal TV of same size. Better color resolution, good sound quality. OS is somewhat slow compare to other TVs in the segment. Overall good experience using this product."
Hi I am thinking to buy 43 inch led tv. I am search many company tv and watch YouTube videos and think which should I buy learn every tv review and I decide to buy xiomi x pro 43 inch after check and watch many negative reviews and I am glad to thanks mi to this tv it's great experience to other brand tv at this price rangeI am manually install this  no need company service for installation remote is very good Bluetooth connectivity and display quality is superb pathwall is üëç4k is awesome great deal
"Whenever using NETFLIX/AMAZON PRIME apps, the TV restarts and then freezes with black screen. Tried FACTORY RESET, however it's of no use. Moreover, HD contents have lagging issues in both the apps. Fortunately the TV is within return period of Amazon. So returning for good."
"MI Tv works only 2 Years from the date of purchase, after that got complaint on Panel and screen, No Service availabilitySo would‚Äôve to choose better another option"
"It‚Äôs been 1.5 months since the purchase, the tv is already started to lag after 15days. Dont purchase, instead put some extra money and go for OG brands"

"I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with my iPhone 11 replacement process and the issues I encountered with the vendor's app. First, the replacement procedure was unnecessarily complicated, with multiple steps that were poorly explained. Communication from the vendor was minimal, leaving me in the dark about the status of my replacement.To make matters worse, the vendor‚Äôs app consistently displayed incorrect information regarding the status of my phone. I was repeatedly shown conflicting status, and at one point, the app indicated that my phone is having some camera issue when it clearly hadn‚Äôt been. This caused a great deal of frustration and confusion.Why are you giving people false hope when you know you'll eventually claim an app error to deny the replacement, even when the customer's phone is functioning perfectly fine?Overall, the entire experience was a nightmare. The lack of transparency, coupled with the app‚Äôs unreliability, made what should have been a straightforward process incredibly stressful. I expected much better service and functionality, especially given the high cost of Apple products. This experience has significantly diminished my trust in both the vendor and the brand."

"Got a faulty phone , after one update it crashed"
Nice phone
Received the Iphone with dead pixels
"So what could have been a great phone has turned into an absolute mockery! My 4.5 year old iPhone 11 is still running well and was a great value for money in the sense that I used it for 4 years instead of 2 that I did my previous phones, it is still serving well, but this one DOES NOT GET AI FEATURES! I still can't digest this, that this is still the latest iphone you can buy in the market, it sells for more than flagship prices and comes with lesser features than competitors and Apple chose not to provide AI features with it making this absolutely unacceptable. Apparently Apple cheaped out on RAM in this and only provided 6 gb whereas AI requires minimum 8 gb of RAM and this is the reason even M1 laptops and tablets with weaker NPU than iPhone 15 get AI and this doesn't! It would have been acceptable if it was a budget/flagship killer costing 30K or below but at this price it is a travesty!Second is the battery! My iPhone 11 with 1150 cycles still has 82% battery health but this one, even with using 80% charge limit function after just 185 cycles is at 94% and lasts noticeably less than when it was new! Just shows Apple is killing this phone on purpose to sell future models and the once mighty Apple who made trouble free actually premium flagships has nothing to innovate and is resorting to cheap tactics to sell phones.Really disappointed!"
"I am facing heating issue while taking photos or videos. Just more than a minute phone got heated. And amazon not providing doorstep technician to this product. They asking me to travel 45 km afar apple service center, to check the phone and get denying letter.Also i have called tollfree number of apple service, they informed i will not face such issue if i bought product from there site, instead of 3rd party. Moreover i have informed the customer service issue on the same day but they are saying no techincian available for this product....And this is not mentioned in the description as well."
You can found best apples in the forest of amazon only. Nice product.
100% ok
"The Product, It's just decent.. It's cheap since I got it for like 64 k 6 months ago, I could have gotten it for even cheaper nowadays but whatever, The price is okay, The phone is pretty much durable, It fell off a floor and had no scratches or anything even though it fell on the floor, it fell on it's side so it was okay, The durability is then, Fine. The appearance.. I bought a pink iphone 15, I should have bought a grey Iphone 15 pro or smth but I saw a few bad reviews about the pro version so I thought I'd buy the pro version of Iphone 16-17 when it releases, So I'm not gonna get AI Aka Apple Intelligence, I'm also a beta user of IOS 18. The phone is fast and runs any game fine unlike the same spec android phones I have, It's smooth and battery lasted 16-17 hours when I played COD with highest graphics and It'd sometimes only stay for 11 Hours, But if you only use it for daily stuff like office or studying, It'll last days.. I bought a airpod pro with this item and they do pair well, the only issue is, I hope they had a password for connecting airpods. The connectivity is fine and the appearance is okay and the smoothness is pretty smooth, Go for it since it's a cheap phone and not that expensive, Don't mind the people who're saying it's bad or expensive since they're probably living in a third world country or something, Iphones are pretty privacy built, but there are things to improve but I'd get more wink of a sleep with it than a android as, Android is creepy with those spot on ads ;; and iphone's aren't free from it if you use google services, so I deleted every google service except gmail and just living, It's a long lasting budget friendly phone, go for it"
After so many follow ups finally received a product. Product is good
"it‚Äôs the best smart phone ( based on personal preference ) available in the market , by all means it does justifies it‚Äôs hype.also got it at such a stealing price, thank you Amazonüôè"
Good price

Very good product .. awesome product .. camera is very good . Connectivity is very goodFor this product . Good mobile phone
This is my second apple order from Amazon. I've also directly ordered from Apple website and I can say that the product is genuine and exactly same as when I get from Apple website. Quick delivery and securely sealed. Kudos to Amazon for trustworthy delivery.
Torn packaging and phone was overheating on the first use.
I got the best experience by the iPhone but I have a humble request from apple that close the emi system a person who seels momos is having this mobile .
CAMERA EXCELLENT.Charger should be included.
What to tell about apple product security reasons excellent
"*Nothing to say about the iPhone. It‚Äôs the best that is available.*Lot to say about Amazon‚Äôs delivery and exchange. Unfortunately had the idea to buy this with exchange of iPhone XR (bought from Amazon itself, invoice existing). On first attempt, the deliver agent says code fro rabbit exchange not working let me re attempt the delivery tomorrow. That tomorrow became 2 days, after lot of phone calls with Amazon and emails to and fro on 2nd attempt The rabbit exchange app that Amazon is mandating for exchange passed all the test (including battery at 80% life). But in the summery showed ‚Äòmri_battery genuine‚Äô and ‚Äòmri_camera genuine‚Äô as failed and generated a code which the delivery agent couldn‚Äôt input in his mobile. Says exchange is rejected ( mind you no message to that effect was displayed in his app), promptly cancels order and goes away.And that is the end of me buying high value electronic goods from Amazon.Do a favour do not buy with exchange from Amazon! You would save yourselves a lot of hassle.And Congratulations Amazon india folks on completing the process to make Amazon the worst customer centric company. May you crash and burn."
"First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side,  so though it is very good in all aspects,  many people may find it very difficult to purchase ."
Authentic product and 5 star for secured delivery. The seller was genuine and trustworthy.

iPhone is only Apple phone. No other wise phone comparative in market than iPhone.
Not that good. Phone is handy and for me I doesn‚Äôt make sense as iPhone X and 15 looks similar and refresh rate too poor. They charged more but big theifs even their competitors are eager to fetch money from customers but not ready to give worth the money. Customers need to slowly have to reject these brands and btw last 14 years using Apple products but it is worst in the sense not much up gradation. iPhone 15 pro max even pathetic
Paying a lots of money for apple 15 .while using apple 15 it‚Äôs gets heats up like a road side brand mobile . Also while on charging mobile getting heats up. It‚Äôs a big with apple 15 . Be aware prior to buy this . I already use this then I share my experience here . Don‚Äôt buy this
I bought the pink one. I could afford it. #milliondollarbaby. I think I would recommend it. Unfortunately I can only afford iPhones
Its very great phone I love it its very nice and great features and love it its very good just go for it
good
Like value for money
Battery backup is very low and getting heated in 15 minutes only this is a duplicate iphone .amazon is selling duplicate
This phone is 5/5 but when you backup your WhatsApp full backup doesn‚Äôt happen and due to which I lot some of my data
"Nice product, safely delivered"

"First and last mistake in choosing a phone is IPhoneYou cannot even record calls, it may be ban in USA but it‚Äôs not in India. Now a days call record is very important. Other many features you have to buy applications. Mostly important tasks are payable which are free in Android"
"It was a good upgrade for me from iPhone 11 to 15.  Product is great but the customer experience given by Amazon was pathetic.  One lesson I learned, never buy any flagship product from Amazon.

Delivery was satisfactorilyProduct was good and safe
Nice mobile. Performance is awesome but pricey.
"Performance , sound quality , value for money , fast charging , touch is very good , battery is üëçüèª"
"Amazing phone, great touch sensitivity"
Am a iPhone fan so no complaints‚Ä¶.
Sound quality is very poor
Main problem with 60hz refresh rateIt's not smooth also battery drainage is a problemMain positive things it's video recording quality(Phato is ok but not high class)And security system is too goodI can't find other positive thingsoverall price is too high  I say it's a overrated products for rough useYou can buy for security reasons and your screen time is under 5 hours
This was my first iPhone using experience.iPhone is better the android .Only draw back is it drain battery fast.
The phone doesn‚Äôt charge and Amazon guys neither gives replacement nor do they help service centre assistance at home. Poor service by Amazon and sub seller who is selling
"Before you go for an s24, remember iphone 15‚Äôs battery and camera and processor performance is way ahead. It lasts me an entire day on 80% charge and just 80% not even a full charge, and the camera is better than most dslrs, use a slim case and do not use the phone while charging and it will never ever heat up. This is the best phone at this price point hands down. Don't waste money on the pro or pro max. The battery is more than enough and if you are a very heavy user then consider the pro max and the display refresh rate is barely noticeable when compared with the pro or max. Only get the pro or max if the extra camera or higher refresh rate (which is barely noticeable) is your concern. The 15 beats every android phone in terms of gaming, smoothness, camera and battery. Ive used the OP 12 and s23 and I would choose the 15 over them anyday."
Camper quality goods
Thank u amazone.
Good product. Camera quality superb.Bit of heating issue but overall nice.Fast dilevery from Amazon . The green color is shiny.
"I love everything like color, touch, back side quality, camera, ultra fast process, etc., and what not?As always Apple rocks"
I hate such a expensive phone heats up while charging with apple adaptor and apple cable.Totally disappointed.Good luck.Update after 1 month- now the heating problem is totally gone. It‚Äôs probably battery initial problem or a software bug that solved automatically.
Not working to friendly apps Truecaller/call recording/and sudirect app really waste of money
I ordered my iPhone 15 from Amazon in the month of November 2023. It worked just fine for few months. After which I was suddenly facing problems with my apps. Specifically Swiggy was not being downloaded and it was saying that my phone is a jailbroken device. I am extremely disappointed with the service.
Battery Draining with in 2 hrs.For charging it consumes min of 1.5 hrs to reach 100%Also Amazon is worst platform to buy this phone.Very worst response
iPhone 15 is faster and better looking than iPhone 12 .
Delivered on same day. Indian version. SBI promo did not work as mentioned. So opted for icici emi on amazon pay card. Nothing to say about iphone. There are plenty of reviews on that.
Really loved the iPhone 15 :)
"worst product that i have ever seen from Apple company, u dont need any kind of stove to coock anything if you have iphone 15 in your hand, trash"
Worth !Camera and Decent Battery
Excellent product. The main concern is while charging the mobile is going too hot. If you touch the mobile whole body is too heating.
Got a very good deal and the model and variant is very Good.Thank you Amazon
"I am using this mobile from past 4 months it‚Äôs value for money , camera quality superb but Apple need to improve battery quality"

"Sound quality is very good. Performance is good and transfer of data from my old iPhone happened very fast. Software update was completed immediately after starting the phone . Only problem is that the charging cable is different and it doesn‚Äôt fit into USB port, so one must have an adapter or order one along with the iPhone."

Communication from the vendor was minimal, leaving me in the dark about the status of my replacement.To make matters worse, the vendor‚Äôs app consistently displayed incorrect information regarding the status of my phone. I was repeatedly shown conflicting status, and at one point, the app indicated that my phone is having some camera issue when it clearly hadn‚Äôt been. This caused a great deal of frustration and confusion.Why are you giving people false hope when you know you'll eventually claim an app error to deny the replacement, even when the customer's phone is functioning perfectly fine?Overall, the entire experience was a nightmare. The lack of transparency, coupled with the app‚Äôs unreliability, made what should have been a straightforward process incredibly stressful. I expected much better service and functionality, especially given the high cost of Apple products. This experience has significantly diminished my trust in both the vendor and the brand."
I like it
"Got a faulty phone , after one update it crashed"
Nice phone
Received the Iphone with dead pixels
"So what could have been a great phone has turned into an absolute mockery! My 4.5 year old iPhone 11 is still running well and was a great value for money in the sense that I used it for 4 years instead of 2 that I did my previous phones, it is still serving well, but this one DOES NOT GET AI FEATURES! I still can't digest this, that this is still the latest iphone you can buy in the market, it sells for more than flagship prices and comes with lesser features than competitors and Apple chose not to provide AI features with it making this absolutely unacceptable. Apparently Apple cheaped out on RAM in this and only provided 6 gb whereas AI requires minimum 8 gb of RAM and this is the reason even M1 laptops and tablets with weaker NPU than iPhone 15 get AI and this doesn't! It would have been acceptable if it was a budget/flagship killer costing 30K or below but at this price it is a travesty!Second is the battery! My iPhone 11 with 1150 cycles still has 82% battery health but this one, even with using 80% charge limit function after just 185 cycles is at 94% and lasts noticeably less than when it was new! Just shows Apple is killing this phone on purpose to sell future models and the once mighty Apple who made trouble free actually premium flagships has nothing to innovate and is resorting to cheap tactics to sell phones.Really disappointed!"
"I am facing heating issue while taking photos or videos. Just more than a minute phone got heated. And amazon not providing doorstep technician to this product. They asking me to travel 45 km afar apple service center, to check the phone and get denying letter.Also i have called tollfree number of apple service, they informed i will not face such issue if i bought product from there site, instead of 3rd party. Moreover i have informed the customer service issue on the same day but they are saying no techincian available for this product....And this is not mentioned in the description as well."
You can found best apples in the forest of amazon only. Nice product.
100% ok
"The Product, It's just decent.. It's cheap since I got it for like 64 k 6 months ago, I could have gotten it for even cheaper nowadays but whatever, The price is okay, The phone is pretty much durable, It fell off a floor and had no scratches or anything even though it fell on the floor, it fell on it's side so it was okay, The durability is then, Fine. The appearance.. I bought a pink iphone 15, I should have bought a grey Iphone 15 pro or smth but I saw a few bad reviews about the pro version so I thought I'd buy the pro version of Iphone 16-17 when it releases, So I'm not gonna get AI Aka Apple Intelligence, I'm also a beta user of IOS 18. The phone is fast and runs any game fine unlike the same spec android phones I have, It's smooth and battery lasted 16-17 hours when I played COD with highest graphics and It'd sometimes only stay for 11 Hours, But if you only use it for daily stuff like office or studying, It'll last days.. I bought a airpod pro with this item and they do pair well, the only issue is, I hope they had a password for connecting airpods. The connectivity is fine and the appearance is okay and the smoothness is pretty smooth, Go for it since it's a cheap phone and not that expensive, Don't mind the people who're saying it's bad or expensive since they're probably living in a third world country or something, Iphones are pretty privacy built, but there are things to improve but I'd get more wink of a sleep with it than a android as, Android is creepy with those spot on ads ;; and iphone's aren't free from it if you use google services, so I deleted every google service except gmail and just living, It's a long lasting budget friendly phone, go for it"
After so many follow ups finally received a product. Product is good
"it‚Äôs the best smart phone ( based on personal preference ) available in the market , by all means it does justifies it‚Äôs hype.also got it at such a stealing price, thank you Amazonüôè"
Good price
"A phone is good and fantasting, and battery is long lasting and charging good, display is smooth and indisplay fingers pin sansor ,"
Very good product .. awesome product .. camera is very good . Connectivity is very goodFor this product . Good mobile phone
This is my second apple order from Amazon. I've also directly ordered from Apple website and I can say that the product is genuine and exactly same as when I get from Apple website. Quick delivery and securely sealed. Kudos to Amazon for trustworthy delivery.
Torn packaging and phone was overheating on the first use.
I got the best experience by the iPhone but I have a humble request from apple that close the emi system a person who seels momos is having this mobile .
CAMERA EXCELLENT.Charger should be included.
What to tell about apple product security reasons excellent
"*Nothing to say about the iPhone. It‚Äôs the best that is available.*Lot to say about Amazon‚Äôs delivery and exchange. Unfortunately had the idea to buy this with exchange of iPhone XR (bought from Amazon itself, invoice existing). On first attempt, the deliver agent says code fro rabbit exchange not working let me re attempt the delivery tomorrow. That tomorrow became 2 days, after lot of phone calls with Amazon and emails to and fro on 2nd attempt The rabbit exchange app that Amazon is mandating for exchange passed all the test (including battery at 80% life). But in the summery showed ‚Äòmri_battery genuine‚Äô and ‚Äòmri_camera genuine‚Äô as failed and generated a code which the delivery agent couldn‚Äôt input in his mobile. Says exchange is rejected ( mind you no message to that effect was displayed in his app), promptly cancels order and goes away.And that is the end of me buying high value electronic goods from Amazon.Do a favour do not buy with exchange from Amazon! You would save yourselves a lot of hassle.And Congratulations Amazon india folks on completing the process to make Amazon the worst customer centric company. May you crash and burn."
"First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side,  so though it is very good in all aspects,  many people may find it very difficult to purchase ."
Authentic product and 5 star for secured delivery. The seller was genuine and trustworthy.
I like
"Over heating and battery drains quickly, never able to use outside due to over heating.  ... . . .  ."
Good
iPhone is only Apple phone. No other wise phone comparative in market than iPhone.
Not that good. Phone is handy and for me I doesn‚Äôt make sense as iPhone X and 15 looks similar and refresh rate too poor. They charged more but big theifs even their competitors are eager to fetch money from customers but not ready to give worth the money. Customers need to slowly have to reject these brands and btw last 14 years using Apple products but it is worst in the sense not much up gradation. iPhone 15 pro max even pathetic
Paying a lots of money for apple 15 .while using apple 15 it‚Äôs gets heats up like a road side brand mobile . Also while on charging mobile getting heats up. It‚Äôs a big with apple 15 . Be aware prior to buy this . I already use this then I share my experience here . Don‚Äôt buy this
I bought the pink one. I could afford it. #milliondollarbaby. I think I would recommend it. Unfortunately I can only afford iPhones
Its very great phone I love it its very nice and great features and love it its very good just go for it
good
Like value for money
Battery backup is very low and getting heated in 15 minutes only this is a duplicate iphone .amazon is selling duplicate
This phone is 5/5 but when you backup your WhatsApp full backup doesn‚Äôt happen and due to which I lot some of my data
"Nice product, safely delivered"
Great performance
Good product
"Ah, major upgrade for me Uk from 4gb storage and 2gb ram phone to 128 gc phone and yea also android to apple, a huge shout out to Apple Inc. For this amazing phone with 28 MegaPixel camera, loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πü´°"
happy with product
Best iPhone in this price
"My office people installed spy app on my mobile, and found Hackable iphone and less online and service centre support."
Experiencing first time üòçüòçüòç Everything is amazing
"First and last mistake in choosing a phone is IPhoneYou cannot even record calls, it may be ban in USA but it‚Äôs not in India. Now a days call record is very important. Other many features you have to buy applications. Mostly important tasks are payable which are free in Android"
"It was a good upgrade for me from iPhone 11 to 15.  Product is great but the customer experience given by Amazon was pathetic.  One lesson I learned, never buy any flagship product from Amazon.  My first order was cancelled due to some technical issue and the second one was due to absolute undervaluation of exchange product (iPhone 11 in my case).  Go for the product..."
Delivery was satisfactorilyProduct was good and safe
Nice mobile. Performance is awesome but pricey.
"Performance , sound quality , value for money , fast charging , touch is very good , battery is üëçüèª"
"Amazing phone, great touch sensitivity"
Am a iPhone fan so no complaints‚Ä¶.
Sound quality is very poor
Main problem with 60hz refresh rateIt's not smooth also battery drainage is a problemMain positive things it's video recording quality(Phato is ok but not high class)And security system is too goodI can't find other positive thingsoverall price is too high  I say it's a overrated products for rough useYou can buy for security reasons and your screen time is under 5 hours
This was my first iPhone using experience.iPhone is better the android .Only draw back is it drain battery fast.
The phone doesn‚Äôt charge and Amazon guys neither gives replacement nor do they help service centre assistance at home. Poor service by Amazon and sub seller who is selling
"Before you go for an s24, remember iphone 15‚Äôs battery and camera and processor performance is way ahead. It lasts me an entire day on 80% charge and just 80% not even a full charge, and the camera is better than most dslrs, use a slim case and do not use the phone while charging and it will never ever heat up. This is the best phone at this price point hands down. Don't waste money on the pro or pro max. The battery is more than enough and if you are a very heavy user then consider the pro max and the display refresh rate is barely noticeable when compared with the pro or max. Only get the pro or max if the extra camera or higher refresh rate (which is barely noticeable) is your concern. The 15 beats every android phone in terms of gaming, smoothness, camera and battery. Ive used the OP 12 and s23 and I would choose the 15 over them anyday."
Camper quality goods
Thank u amazone.
Good product. Camera quality superb.Bit of heating issue but overall nice.Fast dilevery from Amazon . The green color is shiny.
"I love everything like color, touch, back side quality, camera, ultra fast process, etc., and what not?As always Apple rocks"
I hate such a expensive phone heats up while charging with apple adaptor and apple cable.Totally disappointed.Good luck.Update after 1 month- now the heating problem is totally gone. It‚Äôs probably battery initial problem or a software bug that solved automatically.
Not working to friendly apps Truecaller/call recording/and sudirect app really waste of money
I ordered my iPhone 15 from Amazon in the month of November 2023. It worked just fine for few months. After which I was suddenly facing problems with my apps. Specifically Swiggy was not being downloaded and it was saying that my phone is a jailbroken device. I am extremely disappointed with the service.
Battery Draining with in 2 hrs.For charging it consumes min of 1.5 hrs to reach 100%Also Amazon is worst platform to buy this phone.Very worst response
iPhone 15 is faster and better looking than iPhone 12 .
Delivered on same day. Indian version. SBI promo did not work as mentioned. So opted for icici emi on amazon pay card. Nothing to say about iphone. There are plenty of reviews on that.
Really loved the iPhone 15 :)
"worst product that i have ever seen from Apple company, u dont need any kind of stove to coock anything if you have iphone 15 in your hand, trash"
Worth !Camera and Decent Battery
Excellent product. The main concern is while charging the mobile is going too hot. If you touch the mobile whole body is too heating.
Got a very good deal and the model and variant is very Good.Thank you Amazon
"I am using this mobile from past 4 months it‚Äôs value for money , camera quality superb but Apple need to improve battery quality"
Overall good
"Sound quality is very good. Performance is good and transfer of data from my old iPhone happened very fast. Software update was completed immediately after starting the phone . Only problem is that the charging cable is different and it doesn‚Äôt fit into USB port, so one must have an adapter or order one along with the iPhone."
Beautiful‚ù§ pictures
phone is so good but my cash back is not retrun
Good quality phone battery backup camera touch everything ok
Good
"Did something most people consider stupid! Instead of changing battery on my iPhone 12 64GB (costs 8k officially) and since I was running out of space constantly even after iCloud+ subscription and thanks to sale, the exchange price of my old phone with ""bonus"" was 19k...... I ""upgraded"" to a iPhone 13 128GB for 20k. Gonna use it few more years now! ¬Ø\(¬∞_o)/¬Ø"
"No Issue with the product...but there is some suspicious activity between the delivery people, seller and Amazon...was not allowed to avail of the exchange offer by the delivery team and after talking to Amazon found that "" the Exchange offer"" is a farce....Pls beware of this SCAM!!!"
It is an good phone in iphone category under 40k but when compared to android it lacks some features like 120hz and many moreBut you know the psychology of peopleIPhone will be iphone onlySo can go for this under 40k not more than thatI have purchased this phone for my friendAnd he is happy with itSpecially he bought this for cameraEspecially for videography
"Overall phone is nice but battery life is not that good it soon deteriorate . Speakers, screen quality, performance, nice feel in hands, etc are good ."
Best phone in this price
Battery is not good on my device!! I don‚Äôt know why!!
Looking good product and best. Quality worth for money and build quality was super fit to the phone value of money
It's a great phone. Everything is perfect be it's xdr retina display be it camera. I love it to the fullest
"Look of iPhone 13 is awesome.  I brought this today, switching from Android to iPhone.  Battery life is good.  It's in good budget.  My first iPhone...!"
Everything good and pink colour is beauty.

"Good phone overall , bit high in budget but functions well"
"I did have my doubts buying it online but this was great. Amazon is legitimate and reliable.The display quality is superb. It feels smooth!Phone doesn‚Äôt really heat up. Just when it‚Äôs charging which is totally normal. (Try charging your phone without a cover/case.)The phone doesn‚Äôt not hang or lag. Like I said earlier, it‚Äôs smooth!The performance is truly impressive. Once I transferred my data(which was so easy) I didn‚Äôt even have to use my old phone.The camera quality is great. The videos are clear and crisp. The photos are truly stunning. And there are so many settings for you to explore.Coming from an android user, using a phone has never been better! This is my 2nd phone and I‚Äôm really glad it is an iPhone. The experience is amazing.So summing up, this is a great purchase and worth the price."
best qwality phone
Little cutie pie..
"Need time to review because it's my first I phone. I've heard about the update issues. Not going to update now.I think no one need the review of I phone 13 because it's already in market for 3 years.I love the in-hand feel of this phone. Obviously camera is the main reason I bought this phone.Need to study this ios.I got this phone for 39,999 . I think it's a better price. Because this phone is still capable of high level tasks"
Heat most of the times while charging‚Ä¶After ios 18 update i sometimes feels lagging inside the apps .. my battery health is 100% however it‚Äôs less for me ‚Ä¶Checkout other devices in the same range rather than picking this
This is my first iphone.....it is very good and smooth fells heaven in hand when u holding the phone...seller was also good Karnataka to Delhi in one day delivery ‚ù§Ô∏è
One the best phone under 40k

Best non Pro iphone you can buy right now. It's very responsive and fast. Good colour options and best part is it will be receiving apple intelligence updates along with pro models. Honestly I don't think 90 percent of the population needs Pro models. Just go for this if you want an iPhone you won't be disappointed
Amazing iphone and Love the camera and performance of phone . . . . . . . . . .
I have to give my phone in service center due to over heat problem and after 6 days I have my phone. Apple must to update there service center in Gujarat
Apple never disappoints!
"Liked it because of small in size and easy to carry in the pent's pocket.As told, it will be used in the day to life because of it's strong data security."
Good qualityThere was also a side camera  that was excellentCamera was unbelievable it was so good and the screen was smooth
Worth to Money Spending. Its is an amazing phone from apple.
The phone is just amazing! Although there‚Äôs not much difference between iPhone 15 and 16 but i felt that its pretty good. I was using iphone 15plus which is quite bigger size than the regular one and i have small hands so it was hard for me to manage and was facing issue with the heating. But iphone 16 is something i felt that this size is just right for my hands so i am loving it for now. When it comes to the phon colour it is a bit similar to iphone 13 just the matt and the glass difference.
all features are too good nice camera thank Q apple
Wonderful product worth of money
The phone is fine but the box is incredibly dirty and brown. My 4 year old iPhone 12‚Äôs box looks more clean and it‚Äôs shameful that the phone hasn‚Äôt even been out for a month but the box has been kept in a condition that it looks 2 years old.
From speed to looks a handy perfect phoneGo for it without second thoughts if you want an iPhone
"60hz in this price? Are you kidding?  Not acceptable at all, please provide pro motion at this price. Useless upgrade"
For everyone who are looking to by 15 due to its cheaper value will be loosing the opportunity to experience Apples Ai as it would not be available for earlier models.
Genuine product received
Love it
Don't buy this. Waste product . There is no new innovation and there is no new upgrade just photo click button worst

Very poor battery system please don‚Äôt go for itNot at all satisfied with this iphone in terms of battery
Bad not good bad bad not bad good bad no wrong left right uppper niche aage piche daye baye ghar jaye
"Great product from Apple awesome camera, display and camera and action button also good and waiting for Apple AI üòÅ"
Just switch to samsung ultra phones mutch better than apple worst phone ever just the same thing everytime. Not good
This is nice and if your are interested you can buy it .And the overall review is very good it gets A18 chip.
"Really impressed by the phone!Battery has been significantly increased.The image processing pipelines has been greatly improved. Now the colors have a very natural balance. The low light performance has also been increased. Videos now are some next lvl thing.(better than older versions)The performance has a significant increase. The A18 chipset is insanely powerful. Supports ray-tracing and intense graphics consuming games can be played seemlessly.This is a must upgrade phone. If you're thinking to buy some good shi you definitely must invest on this. This is WORTH EVERY PENNY I invested.But keep in mind if you're switching from Android to iOS, you're gonna have major problems my friend :)"
Using this phone for the last 5 months.. no issues till date.. amazing phone.. thank you Amazon
Nice Phone Under 60k Accha Phone He Bhai Use Karo Or Muje Bolo Aap Sabko Bhi Kaisa Laga Theek he na
"Don‚Äôt buy iPhone, you will not be able to connect with windows or USB drives and transfer files into iPhone. The Apple OS can only with any other apple product only. Otherwise you have to pay and then only access iTunes. For creating backup of your messages and files it says pay for additional space in iCloud. So the Mac OS is made such that either you purchase some other apple device and pay for all access"
It‚Äôs iPhone man ‚Ä¶
There is no problem with product but delivery associate charged more 4000/ rupees in his personal account without giving any more receipt.
I‚Äôm still using this phone and delivery is very fast. Got the phone in premium packing. Nice delivery.
I have noticed first time camera is applying filter from software device. It seems camera is taking support of device software to enhance quality. They might be degrade quality after iOS update. Like happened with me in 8Plus.
Good product
As time passes its colour/ paint comes out. As we remove phone cover frequently it left some marks on the edges of the phone. And mute button also left the colour and left behind is what a bad look silver patch. (I know only about my BLACK Iphone)
"I have upgraded to 15 after 11The camera quality is excellent, as usual. If you‚Äôre switching from Apple to Apple, it is user-friendly. After ios 18 update , the interface is fantastic.A value for money product with good color accuracy"
Excellent phone
"I am using mobile from last 15 yrs. After many Android mobile, this my first I purchased first iPhone 2 months back. Now I am telling, this is the worst mobile I am using after 60K plus investment. First and major drawback video call not possible while calling to a android mobile. Just think after paying 60K plus for a mobile, we have to using WhatsApp or another supporting app for video calling. Also very dissatisfied while using different apps."
Nice
Works real smooooth‚Ä¶. Its been an year and have my battery % at 88% now‚Ä¶.worth it even now in 24
Please don‚Äôt purchase this product here.

Camera quality and battery dislike
"The phone isn't in its original condition. The battery is unauthorised, power button isn't working and failed each and every quality test check at authorised apple service center. When asked for replacement or return, i am still at hold, asked to submit demonstration certificate."
"I got the phone with the phone box dentedThe phone has smuts on the back. The phone often has blackout and glitches. My WhatsApp was half black half on display. I just wanted a regular working iPhone, but after repeated calls in the return period of Amazon, I called them five times or even more and they basically just said go to Apple, but Apple said you bought it from Amazon. can‚Äôt help you so Amazon, then said we can‚Äôt help you too. I‚Äôm stuck with a phone worth 90 K that glitches very often.Thank you, Amazon, for your very, very unhelpful customer care"
It doesn't seem orginal iphone

How come one new phone package can be like this ? Hope it‚Äôs new phone only
poor quality through and through except camera. its display is worse than oneplus 7t pro with more reflections and poor refresh rate. apple stifles third party integration like huawei watch and thus cannot use find phone feature unless app is open and minimized.mail sync doesnt refresh. eg android will refresh notification when mail is deleted or read on other source. animation is like a blink giving poor interaction. auto word correction is so bad that i turned it off. always on feature is not there despite oled. oled wuality black itself is bad because of extreme reflection. there was one good paid app files that apple replaced with its own and disabled ftp. cannot share photo on bluetooth.  too many crappy deliberate limitations. i disnt check otg feature and i am sure it is restricted and not there on apple.overall i decided to go back to oneplus loosing about ‚Çπ45k in short few months. data is more important for me than phone.i had migrated from apple to bb in 2015. then to android in 2017. going back feels like going to stone agefinally speaker quality is bad. really bad with out of sync lower ends sounding like cheap woofer setup.camera is ok but then i am comparing to 7t pro and when i really need quality then i anyway use my fujifilm that no iphone can compare tosuch a terrible waste of moneyps: wireless charging is a joke with temp reaching 40 degrees. even wired charging reaches 37. this in controlled temp of 27 degree room temp. oneolus 7t pro barely touches 35 despite much faster charging speed
"The iPhone 15- Elegant design with high-quality materials- Superb Super Retina XDR display- Powerful A16 Bionic chip for top-tier performance- Excellent camera quality with advanced features- Seamless integration within the Apple ecosystem-No significant design changes from previous modelsThe iPhone 15 is an excellent choice for users seeking a high-end smartphone with exceptional performance, display quality, and camera capabilities. While it may be expensive, it offers a polished and reliable user experience"
"Competitively priced for iPhone but quality is average,nothing great."
"It has all that you need, pro model features are not required by most use purposes"

There is no problem with product but delivery associate charged more 4000/ rupees in his personal account without giving any more receipt.
I‚Äôm still using this phone and delivery is very fast. Got the phone in premium packing. Nice delivery.
I have noticed first time camera is applying filter from software device. It seems camera is taking support of device software to enhance quality. They might be degrade quality after iOS update. Like happened with me in 8Plus.

As time passes its colour/ paint comes out. As we remove phone cover frequently it left some marks on the edges of the phone. And mute button also left the colour and left behind is what a bad look silver patch. (I know only about my BLACK Iphone)

poor quality through and through except camera. its display is worse than oneplus 7t pro with more reflections and poor refresh rate. apple stifles third party integration like huawei watch and thus cannot use find phone feature unless app is open and minimized.mail sync doesnt refresh. eg android will refresh notification when mail is deleted or read on other source. animation is like a blink giving poor interaction. auto word correction is so bad that i turned it off. always on feature is not there despite oled. oled wuality black itself is bad because of extreme reflection. there was one good paid app files that apple replaced with its own and disabled ftp. cannot share photo on bluetooth.  too many crappy deliberate limitations. i disnt check otg feature and i am sure it is restricted and not there on apple.overall i decided to go back to oneplus loosing about ‚Çπ45k in short few months. data is more important for me than phone.i had migrated from apple to bb in 2015. then to android in 2017. going back feels like going to stone agefinally speaker quality is bad. really bad with out of sync lower ends sounding like cheap woofer setup.camera is ok but then i am comparing to 7t pro and when i really need quality then i anyway use my fujifilm that no iphone can compare tosuch a terrible waste of moneyps: wireless charging is a joke with temp reaching 40 degrees. even wired charging reaches 37. this in controlled temp of 27 degree room temp. oneolus 7t pro barely touches 35 despite much faster charging speed

Mind blowing experience‚Ä¶.even a lot of people says that samsung is better but they only compare with 100x zoom i want to says to those people lets compare with overall experience üòú
"The SIM Card used in my Samsung Phone was installed in the new IPhone 13. While outgoing calls were okay, incoming calls were getting rejected at the caller end. The calls were getting cut off without the phone ringing and callers receiving message that phone is not reachable. There is obviously a defect with the phone."
"As a Android lover, didn't liked this"
Very good product value for money apple products are very fast and good battery life is also better and my game is much smoother

Requesting replacement please. The battery is draining too fast (even with all the apps closed etc). It is literally less than 25% of my Xiaomi redmi phone battery. This cannot be right.

"Nothing is here to dislike, Loved the product and service by Amazon"
I purchase iPhone 13 128gb in Blue colour phone is good but delivery packing is not good Amazon team pls don't share in losse packing in iPhone.
Seems like ‚Ä¶ I got the used  product‚Ä¶Kindly buy from the original store itself !! üòì
"First of all, I'm so excited haha üòÖThis is my first time owning a phone. Without hesitation I just go for it with the iPhone 13 (Starlight) 128Gb. Personally I'm just obsessed with the design and the Starlight color is so cleanüòç‚ú® I also like the new camera lens layout placed diagonally. My friends think that I'm holding iPhone 15üòÖü§≠In terms of performance, I can't really give a review,  since it's my first phone there's none to compare. But I can tell it's smooth like butter.I would highly recommend to go for it if you plan on buying your first phone. ü§óü§çAccesories:Lastly, I also bought a screen protector and a case from Spigen. This doesn't change the look and design of the phone. It looks more aesthetic and I love it. Thanks for reading. See ya..üå∏"
Great condition
Delivering very late.waiting long .I can't wait for very long please cancel phone.please return money.i will buy I phone 15
Good

It's good device just overpriced
"Bought iphone 13 product red and seems like its defective, it won't charge with type c to lightning type cable in box. I did try with other type c to lightning type cables but its of no use. When I tried to contact amazon customer care, they told to get this sorted by apple first and then they might take this for return. Now I am using it with usb to lightning type cable, its working ok, but matter of fact is its defective."
Just a average photo
Better service
I purchased this phone a year back at MRP and right after 12 month the prices are slashed by 28% is not a good sign. It shows that it is not worth to buy iPhone. The resale value is not good of this iPhone.Instead Android phone has a good resale value. Recommend to buy an Motorola
"The iPhone 13 still rocks the shelves. It is more or less the same as the iPhone 14. The two phones have the same screen size, look the same, and have many similarities.It appears that the iPhone 13 is people‚Äôs first choice when getting a new iPhone, especially if they are on a budget."

"I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with my iPhone 11 replacement process and the issues I encountered with the vendor's app. First, the replacement procedure was unnecessarily complicated, with multiple steps that were poorly explained. Communication from the vendor was minimal, leaving me in the dark about the status of my replacement.To make matters worse, the vendor‚Äôs app consistently displayed incorrect information regarding the status of my phone. I was repeatedly shown conflicting status, and at one point, the app indicated that my phone is having some camera issue when it clearly hadn‚Äôt been. This caused a great deal of frustration and confusion.Why are you giving people false hope when you know you'll eventually claim an app error to deny the replacement, even when the customer's phone is functioning perfectly fine?Overall, the entire experience was a nightmare. The lack of transparency, coupled with the app‚Äôs unreliability, made what should have been a straightforward process incredibly stressful. I expected much better service and functionality, especially given the high cost of Apple products. This experience has significantly diminished my trust in both the vendor and the brand."
I like it
"Got a faulty phone , after one update it crashed"
Nice phone
"Received the Iphone with dead pixels, it had dead pixels on arrival, Amazon customer support was of no help."
"So what could have been a great phone has turned into an absolute mockery! My 4.5 year old iPhone 11 is still running well and was a great value for money in the sense that I used it for 4 years instead of 2 that I did my previous phones, it is still serving well, but this one DOES NOT GET AI FEATURES! I still can't digest this, that this is still the latest iphone you can buy in the market, it sells for more than flagship prices and comes with lesser features than competitors and Apple chose not to provide AI features with it making this absolutely unacceptable. Apparently Apple cheaped out on RAM in this and only provided 6 gb whereas AI requires minimum 8 gb of RAM and this is the reason even M1 laptops and tablets with weaker NPU than iPhone 15 get AI and this doesn't! It would have been acceptable if it was a budget/flagship killer costing 30K or below but at this price it is a travesty!Second is the battery! My iPhone 11 with 1150 cycles still has 82% battery health but this one, even with using 80% charge limit function after just 185 cycles is at 94% and lasts noticeably less than when it was new! Just shows Apple is killing this phone on purpose to sell future models and the once mighty Apple who made trouble free actually premium flagships has nothing to innovate and is resorting to cheap tactics to sell phones.Really disappointed!"
"I am facing heating issue while taking photos or videos. Just more than a minute phone got heated. And amazon not providing doorstep technician to this product. They asking me to travel 45 km afar apple service center, to check the phone and get denying letter.Also i have called tollfree number of apple service, they informed i will not face such issue if i bought product from there site, instead of 3rd party. Moreover i have informed the customer service issue on the same day but they are saying no techincian available for this product....And this is not mentioned in the description as well."
You can found best apples in the forest of amazon only. Nice product.
100% ok
"The Product, It's just decent.. It's cheap since I got it for like 64 k 6 months ago, I could have gotten it for even cheaper nowadays but whatever, The price is okay, The phone is pretty much durable, It fell off a floor and had no scratches or anything even though it fell on the floor, it fell on it's side so it was okay, The durability is then, Fine. The appearance.. I bought a pink iphone 15, I should have bought a grey Iphone 15 pro or smth but I saw a few bad reviews about the pro version so I thought I'd buy the pro version of Iphone 16-17 when it releases, So I'm not gonna get AI Aka Apple Intelligence, I'm also a beta user of IOS 18. The phone is fast and runs any game fine unlike the same spec android phones I have, It's smooth and battery lasted 16-17 hours when I played COD with highest graphics and It'd sometimes only stay for 11 Hours, But if you only use it for daily stuff like office or studying, It'll last days.. I bought a airpod pro with this item and they do pair well, the only issue is, I hope they had a password for connecting airpods. The connectivity is fine and the appearance is okay and the smoothness is pretty smooth, Go for it since it's a cheap phone and not that expensive, Don't mind the people who're saying it's bad or expensive since they're probably living in a third world country or something, Iphones are pretty privacy built, but there are things to improve but I'd get more wink of a sleep with it than a android as, Android is creepy with those spot on ads ;; and iphone's aren't free from it if you use google services, so I deleted every google service except gmail and just living, It's a long lasting budget friendly phone, go for it"
After so many follow ups finally received a product. Product is good
"it‚Äôs the best smart phone ( based on personal preference ) available in the market , by all means it does justifies it‚Äôs hype.also got it at such a stealing price, thank you Amazonüôè"

This is my second apple order from Amazon. I've also directly ordered from Apple website and I can say that the product is genuine and exactly same as when I get from Apple website. Quick delivery and securely sealed. Kudos to Amazon for trustworthy delivery.
Torn packaging and phone was overheating on the first use.
I got the best experience by the iPhone but I have a humble request from apple that close the emi system a person who seels momos is having this mobile .
CAMERA EXCELLENT.Charger should be included.
What to tell about apple product security reasons excellent
"*Nothing to say about the iPhone. It‚Äôs the best that is available.*Lot to say about Amazon‚Äôs delivery and exchange. Unfortunately had the idea to buy this with exchange of iPhone XR (bought from Amazon itself, invoice existing). On first attempt, the deliver agent says code fro rabbit exchange not working let me re attempt the delivery tomorrow. That tomorrow became 2 days, after lot of phone calls with Amazon and emails to and fro on 2nd attempt The rabbit exchange app that Amazon is mandating for exchange passed all the test (including battery at 80% life). But in the summery showed ‚Äòmri_battery genuine‚Äô and ‚Äòmri_camera genuine‚Äô as failed and generated a code which the delivery agent couldn‚Äôt input in his mobile. Says exchange is rejected ( mind you no message to that effect was displayed in his app), promptly cancels order and goes away.And that is the end of me buying high value electronic goods from Amazon.Do a favour do not buy with exchange from Amazon! You would save yourselves a lot of hassle.And Congratulations Amazon india folks on completing the process to make Amazon the worst customer centric company. May you crash and burn."

Excellent phone
"I am using mobile from last 15 yrs. After many Android mobile, this my first I purchased first iPhone 2 months back. Now I am telling, this is the worst mobile I am using after 60K plus investment. First and major drawback video call not possible while calling to a android mobile. Just think after paying 60K plus for a mobile, we have to using WhatsApp or another supporting app for video calling. Also very dissatisfied while using different apps."
Nice

Camera quality and battery dislike
"The phone isn't in its original condition. The battery is unauthorised, power button isn't working and failed each and every quality test check at authorised apple service center. When asked for replacement or return, i am still at hold, asked to submit demonstration certificate."
"I got the phone with the phone box dentedThe phone has smuts on the back. The phone often has blackout and glitches. My WhatsApp was half black half on display. I just wanted a regular working iPhone, but after repeated calls in the return period of Amazon, I called them five times or even more and they basically just said go to Apple, but Apple said you bought it from Amazon. can‚Äôt help you so Amazon, then said we can‚Äôt help you too. I‚Äôm stuck with a phone worth 90 K that glitches very often.Thank you, Amazon, for your very, very unhelpful customer care"
It doesn't seem orginal iphone

How come one new phone package can be like this ? Hope it‚Äôs new phone only
poor quality through and through except camera. its display is worse than oneplus 7t pro with more reflections and poor refresh rate. apple stifles third party integration like huawei watch and thus cannot use find phone feature unless app is open and minimized.mail sync doesnt refresh. eg android will refresh notification when mail is deleted or read on other source. animation is like a blink giving poor interaction. auto word correction is so bad that i turned it off. always on feature is not there despite oled. oled wuality black itself is bad because of extreme reflection. there was one good paid app files that apple replaced with its own and disabled ftp. cannot share photo on bluetooth.  too many crappy deliberate limitations. i disnt check otg feature and i am sure it is restricted and not there on apple.overall i decided to go back to oneplus loosing about ‚Çπ45k in short few months. data is more important for me than phone.i had migrated from apple to bb in 2015. then to android in 2017. going back feels like going to stone agefinally speaker quality is bad. really bad with out of sync lower ends sounding like cheap woofer setup.camera is ok but then i am comparing to 7t pro and when i really need quality then i anyway use my fujifilm that no iphone can compare tosuch a terrible waste of moneyps: wireless charging is a joke with temp reaching 40 degrees. even wired charging reaches 37. this in controlled temp of 27 degree room temp. oneolus 7t pro barely touches 35 despite much faster charging speed
"The iPhone 15- Elegant design with high-quality materials- Superb Super Retina XDR display- Powerful A16 Bionic chip for top-tier performance- Excellent camera quality with advanced features- Seamless integration within the Apple ecosystem-No significant design changes from previous modelsThe iPhone 15 is an excellent choice for users seeking a high-end smartphone with exceptional performance, display quality, and camera capabilities. While it may be expensive, it offers a polished and reliable user experience"
"Competitively priced for iPhone but quality is average,nothing great."
"It has all that you need, pro model features are not required by most use purposes"

"The phone is very good battery quality, and fast charging I like the iPhone I think this is my best phone"
"Camera clarity is very nice, features are great, C type charging cable.Overall very nice and satisfactory experience with iPhone 15."
"It was a gift for my 16th bday, what would you expect, it‚Äôs an iPhone ofc it‚Äôs the best in class and has the best capabilities. If you‚Äôre thinking of buying it then just go for it, it is the best!"
Running smoothly..no problem at all.Camera is good and battery life is also good manage one day charging..also charge with any type c charging.Worth it phone under this range.
"I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with my iPhone 11 replacement process and the issues I encountered with the vendor's app. First, the replacement procedure was unnecessarily complicated, with multiple steps that were poorly explained. Communication from the vendor was minimal, leaving me in the dark about the status of my replacement.To make matters worse, the vendor‚Äôs app consistently displayed incorrect information regarding the status of my phone. I was repeatedly shown conflicting status, and at one point, the app indicated that my phone is having some camera issue when it clearly hadn‚Äôt been. This caused a great deal of frustration and confusion.Why are you giving people false hope when you know you'll eventually claim an app error to deny the replacement, even when the customer's phone is functioning perfectly fine?Overall, the entire experience was a nightmare. The lack of transparency, coupled with the app‚Äôs unreliability, made what should have been a straightforward process incredibly stressful. I expected much better service and functionality, especially given the high cost of Apple products. This experience has significantly diminished my trust in both the vendor and the brand."
I like it
"Got a faulty phone , after one update it crashed"
Nice phone
"Received the Iphone with dead pixels, it had dead pixels on arrival, Amazon customer support was of no help."
"So what could have been a great phone has turned into an absolute mockery! My 4.5 year old iPhone 11 is still running well and was a great value for money in the sense that I used it for 4 years instead of 2 that I did my previous phones, it is still serving well, but this one DOES NOT GET AI FEATURES! I still can't digest this, that this is still the latest iphone you can buy in the market, it sells for more than flagship prices and comes with lesser features than competitors and Apple chose not to provide AI features with it making this absolutely unacceptable. Apparently Apple cheaped out on RAM in this and only provided 6 gb whereas AI requires minimum 8 gb of RAM and this is the reason even M1 laptops and tablets with weaker NPU than iPhone 15 get AI and this doesn't! It would have been acceptable if it was a budget/flagship killer costing 30K or below but at this price it is a travesty!Second is the battery! My iPhone 11 with 1150 cycles still has 82% battery health but this one, even with using 80% charge limit function after just 185 cycles is at 94% and lasts noticeably less than when it was new! Just shows Apple is killing this phone on purpose to sell future models and the once mighty Apple who made trouble free actually premium flagships has nothing to innovate and is resorting to cheap tactics to sell phones.Really disappointed!"
"I am facing heating issue while taking photos or videos. Just more than a minute phone got heated. And amazon not providing doorstep technician to this product. They asking me to travel 45 km afar apple service center, to check the phone and get denying letter.Also i have called tollfree number of apple service, they informed i will not face such issue if i bought product from there site, instead of 3rd party. Moreover i have informed the customer service issue on the same day but they are saying no techincian available for this product....And this is not mentioned in the description as well."
You can found best apples in the forest of amazon only. Nice product.
100% ok
"The Product, It's just decent.. It's cheap since I got it for like 64 k 6 months ago, I could have gotten it for even cheaper nowadays but whatever, The price is okay, The phone is pretty much durable, It fell off a floor and had no scratches or anything even though it fell on the floor, it fell on it's side so it was okay, The durability is then, Fine. The appearance.. I bought a pink iphone 15, I should have bought a grey Iphone 15 pro or smth but I saw a few bad reviews about the pro version so I thought I'd buy the pro version of Iphone 16-17 when it releases, So I'm not gonna get AI Aka Apple Intelligence, I'm also a beta user of IOS 18. The phone is fast and runs any game fine unlike the same spec android phones I have, It's smooth and battery lasted 16-17 hours when I played COD with highest graphics and It'd sometimes only stay for 11 Hours, But if you only use it for daily stuff like office or studying, It'll last days.. I bought a airpod pro with this item and they do pair well, the only issue is, I hope they had a password for connecting airpods. The connectivity is fine and the appearance is okay and the smoothness is pretty smooth, Go for it since it's a cheap phone and not that expensive, Don't mind the people who're saying it's bad or expensive since they're probably living in a third world country or something, Iphones are pretty privacy built, but there are things to improve but I'd get more wink of a sleep with it than a android as, Android is creepy with those spot on ads ;; and iphone's aren't free from it if you use google services, so I deleted every google service except gmail and just living, It's a long lasting budget friendly phone, go for it"
After so many follow ups finally received a product. Product is good

Best non Pro iphone you can buy right now. It's very responsive and fast. Good colour options and best part is it will be receiving apple intelligence updates along with pro models. Honestly I don't think 90 percent of the population needs Pro models. Just go for this if you want an iPhone you won't be disappointed
Amazing iphone and Love the camera and performance of phone . . . . . . . . . .
I have to give my phone in service center due to over heat problem and after 6 days I have my phone. Apple must to update there service center in Gujarat
Apple never disappoints!
"Liked it because of small in size and easy to carry in the pent's pocket.As told, it will be used in the day to life because of it's strong data security."
Good qualityThere was also a side camera  that was excellentCamera was unbelievable it was so good and the screen was smooth
Worth to Money Spending. Its is an amazing phone from apple.
The phone is just amazing! Although there‚Äôs not much difference between iPhone 15 and 16 but i felt that its pretty good. I was using iphone 15plus which is quite bigger size than the regular one and i have small hands so it was hard for me to manage and was facing issue with the heating. But iphone 16 is something i felt that this size is just right for my hands so i am loving it for now. When it comes to the phon colour it is a bit similar to iphone 13 just the matt and the glass difference.
all features are too good nice camera thank Q apple
Wonderful product worth of money
The phone is fine but the box is incredibly dirty and brown. My 4 year old iPhone 12‚Äôs box looks more clean and it‚Äôs shameful that the phone hasn‚Äôt even been out for a month but the box has been kept in a condition that it looks 2 years old.
From speed to looks a handy perfect phoneGo for it without second thoughts if you want an iPhone
"60hz in this price? Are you kidding?  Not acceptable at all, please provide pro motion at this price. Useless upgrade"
For everyone who are looking to by 15 due to its cheaper value will be loosing the opportunity to experience Apples Ai as it would not be available for earlier models.

"Great product from Apple awesome camera, display and camera and action button also good and waiting for Apple AI üòÅ"
Just switch to samsung ultra phones mutch better than apple worst phone ever just the same thing everytime. Not good
This is nice and if your are interested you can buy it .And the overall review is very good it gets A18 chip.
"Really impressed by the phone!Battery has been significantly increased.The image processing pipelines has been greatly improved. Now the colors have a very natural balance. The low light performance has also been increased. Videos now are some next lvl thing.(better than older versions)The performance has a significant increase. The A18 chipset is insanely powerful. Supports ray-tracing and intense graphics consuming games can be played seemlessly.This is a must upgrade phone. If you're thinking to buy some good shi you definitely must invest on this. This is WORTH EVERY PENNY I invested.But keep in mind if you're switching from Android to iOS, you're gonna have major problems my friend :)"

"Chicken was totally poisonous. It came to my home at 9:49pm on 22 Oct'24 with horrible smell and colour. I boiled 1piece and gave to my pet dog GS. After taking it he fell ill with continuous vomiting. If human takes it, what'll be condition just think ! So am v much angry and disappointed with AF and 'll try to not purchase from this market üò°"
So bad chicken they are not very bad
It was good
Halal certified brand for people who are religious and eat halal only
"Chicken was not fresh, unpleasant odour. Quality has been deteriorated ."
Over all fresh chicken
"No fresh taste and filthy smell, I wonder what happened for the quality"
"The meats are fresh, juicy, and cleaned very well"
Good quality chicken
Quality is good. Standards of the product are well maintained. Price is slightly costly. Overall good choice.
Product is not fresh
"This is my second time I had received last day expiry chickenOrdered two packets, one was smelling stale. will never order again"
"Delevery lateWhen washed white water appearance,smell was there.Product dispatched at 1 .55pm.delevered 4 .30pm"
Chicken was not at all fresh and was having foul smell. Rotten meat.
The item was good. Only concern is the pieces was big for the size of curry cut.
Foul smell coming out when opened the packet.
Piece mix and quality were excellent. Did not use a pressure cooker to cook and it still took very little time to get soft in the pot. Loved the quality.
Very bad.... Its not fresh... Smell like old
Chicken is old and mushy! Majorly bones! Quality is unacceptably poor!
Fresh quality. But quantity wise bit disappointed.
it seems more days frozen that why may be test differs then original
Chicken wasn‚Äôt fresh
Usually bought fresh to home chicken. But this time it was rotten and useless.Waste of money .Never expected this
Have ordered couple of times  from ‚Äò Fresh to home‚Äô chicken was fresh . This time it wasn‚Äôt fresh .
I have ordered many a times and it was always freshyou would get medium sized 5/6 piecesJust dont increase price if possible
It looks like a Stored one. Tatse also different.Go with office
Bad smell and not fresh. Also quality  not good.
Product was rotten and foul smelling.
I have never experienced this kind of bad meat delivery experience. Bad stench and even after cooking also the stench was there and we thrown the curry.
Good
Dont buy its giving bad smell I throwed to dustbin. Waste of money
The delivery details were provided but the product will be cancelled after the status ‚ÄúOut for Delivery‚Äù
Very bad experience. Rotten chicken delivered. Dont buy from Amazon fresh.Very bad experience. Rotten chicken delivered. Dont buy from Amazon fresh.
Less quantity
Not frozen
Delivered old item. Bad taste experience.
It was like in a stage of khemma
Chicken smell is bad and sent very close to expiry date
"Chicken is so smelly and not fresh ,don‚Äôt buy"
Superb
Only bones are there... No meat
I have received a fouled meat.
Chicken is stinking inside the package.
"It's a waste of money, costly than Baramati agro chicken & all pieces are bones only ,you have to search for boneless chicken,I would recommend delicious chicken from Baramati agro,I have used it ,great chicken"
Depends on date it's fresh or expired.
Feels like dead chicken being cut.  Smell of rat dieing.  Ewww
"It's been just over 7 years since the last time I purchased packaged processed chicken/meat, it came from a pre 1947 era brand yet the quality was so bad that I decided to stick to local butcher all these years. But very recently decided to give it a shot to this new brand as it comes with new industry standard (vacuum packaging) which I had only seen in foreign countries. I have nothing against these brands but the whole vacuum packaging seems to be real culprit here, there was awful meaty/egg smell coming from these packs as soon as delivery guy handed them over to me, this mainly due to thawing that happened during the transit. Had to put in refrigerator and pull it out just before cooking, as soon as I opened the pack I could feel chicken juices had formed a slimy coating over every piece, had to wash it (multiple times) thoroughly to get rid off it. Then came the cooking part where I could see meat cracking up into small pieces this is mainly due to meat going through the wild temperature swings from the time it was processed. Just like last time I am never ever going to buy these packaged processed meats from here onwards, they are far too inferior when compared to the one you get at local butcher shop right before your eyes."
Dislike
"Recently i ordered chicken from fresh to home this order is delivered with in 30 mins, chicken was so tender and tasty.Thanks Amazon"
Good but not that so it can become the only near store for us. Chicken were fresh never frozen but it's not tender.Suerly one can try anytime but not sure taste is not that great.
They are selling pure halal meat.When I enquired there is no option for non halal.Hindhus sentiments they won't consider and quality issues also there.Better fresh meat near by shop
"Worst quality of chocken I hav ever had, not at all clean. Do not eat it."
"I've been searching high and low for chicken that I feel good about feeding my family, and I've finally found it with this antibiotic-residue-free option. The peace of mind knowing that what we're eating is free from harmful residues is invaluable.I appreciate the transparency of the company and their commitment to providing a healthier option for consumers. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for high-quality, responsibly sourced poultry."
More bones than the meat .The meat part has been removed from the breast pieces..
Stay away. Not fresh. Stale product
"Amazingly bad smell, worst purchase ever."
Chicken is cleaned and fresh
Not fresh
It was full of blood. We could not marinate.
"Don't buy.... smells like hell, I stopped eating chicken"
Chciken pieces were not fresh.
Good but not that so it can become the only near store for us. Chicken were fresh never frozen but it's not tender.Suerly one can try anytime but not sure taste is not that great.
"I have discontinued buying products from Freshtohome due to constant quality issues. They are most of the time smelly, rotten products which are sent a day or two before the expiry date. I now prefer buying other brands & am content. Wish Amazon give me better options by promoting other brand products."
"Some white chemical was there, and it tested even after washing and cooking. Never order from here"
Meat is not so fresh.. and received the items with all bone related and not as shownSo please take care little extra cautious to check the meat
Good product.
"Hi everyone,Please don't buy it's really pathetic smelly and disgusting product you ever see.try to buy from shop itself , horrible experience ever faced ,i suggest please try to buy from shop itself ...."
"Meat was smelling like rotten meat, while washing it was leaving white soap like water.After cooking it smelled like rotting meat.Thrown out immediately :/"
"Smelly chicken , we had to throw the item. Do not recommed fresh2home at all in mumbai"
Curry cut 500gms hardly have any flesh. It just had bones. Gives an impression if they packed waste part instead of main.
The foul smell will make u feel disgusting to eat. there is nothing fresh about this brand
Very old stock smells very bad
Don't take ...it's not air sealed and leakage
The pieces were very small.You should provide the meat in various sizes.Quality was very good and clean too
I always prefer fresh to home but this time I had to throw the entire meat because of the bad smell was coming from it and the meat texture felt like it has been already cooked!! Though I am an old customer of Fresh to Home but if this happens again I am not sure I am ordering again!
The delicious chicken pre cut was rotten. It was smelling like dead rotten meat. Pls don‚Äôt order this if you don‚Äôt want serious diarrhoea.
Not fresh
"Smell was disgusting, rotten chicken."
"Don't but this if you are caring about your health. Old stcks , rotten and full of bad smell will come out when you cut the plastic packet. Do not understand how Amazon is allowing this unhelthy , unhygenic product. Surely it will help to increase you stomach problem after eating this."
"Rotten smell of chicken. Washed plenty of time to get rid of the smell. But all invain. Kindly do not buy from Amazon fresh. Licious is great brand and it's fresh & juiciest. Better change name from ""Fresh to home"" to "" Stale/ Rotten to home"""
Good quality
It's not fresh.
Slimy and stale. Threw
The chicken was good and value for money when you get good discounts. But it was not as tender as the chicken delivered by the leading meat delivery company.
Worst Chicken never buy anymore thanks
